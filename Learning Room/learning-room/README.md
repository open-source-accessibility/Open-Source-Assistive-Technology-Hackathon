# Welcome to the Learning Room

This repository is the shared practice space for the Open Source Assistive Technology Hackathon. It is a real GitHub repository where you will:

- File your first issue
- Leave your first comment
- Open your first pull request
- Review someone else's pull request

Everything in this repository is designed for learning. The files in `docs/` have intentional issues that you will find and fix during the workshop contribution sprint.

## 🤖 About the Automation Bot

When you open a pull request, an automated bot will:

- ✅ **Check your changes** against quality standards
- ♿ **Validate accessibility** (heading hierarchy, link text, alt text, broken links)
- 📚 **Provide educational feedback** explaining why things matter
- 🔗 **Link to resources** for learning more
- 🏷️ **Apply labels** to help facilitators prioritize reviews

**The bot is not a substitute for peer review!** It provides instant technical feedback so your human reviewers can focus on higher-level improvements, creative suggestions, and encouragement.

### How to Interact with the Bot

**Reading Bot Comments:**
- Bot posts ONE comment that updates as you make changes
- Use headings to navigate (Required Checks, Suggestions, Accessibility Analysis, Resources)
- Each issue includes file/line numbers and how to fix it

**Getting Help from the Bot:**
Comment on your PR with keywords:
- `@bot help` — Get help information
- Mention "merge conflict" — Get conflict resolution guide  
- Mention "request review" — Get instructions for requesting human review

**When You Disagree:**
The bot isn't always right! If you believe feedback is incorrect:
1. Comment explaining your reasoning
2. Request human review
3. Facilitators can override bot checks
