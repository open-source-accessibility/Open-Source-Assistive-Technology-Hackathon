## Common Issues and Workarounds

**NVDA reads the GitHub page too slowly:**
In NVDA Settings → Browse Mode → increase Maximum number of characters on one line to 10000.

**JAWS loses track of where I am on the Issues list:**
Press JAWS key + F5 to re-read the current page. If that does not help, refresh the page (F5) and navigate fresh.

**VoiceOver does not read new content when filter results refresh:**
GitHub issue list filtering updates via JavaScript. If VoiceOver does not announce the updated count, navigate to the heading of the list (H key) and read from there.

**The diff table in Files Changed is hard to read:**
The improved Files Changed experience has been enabled by default since January 2026, providing better screen reader landmarks and keyboard navigation. If you're experiencing issues, check your [Feature preview settings](https://github.com/settings/feature_previews) to ensure you haven't opted out.
