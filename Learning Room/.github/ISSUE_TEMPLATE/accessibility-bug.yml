      label: Type of Accessibility Issue
      description: Which category best describes what you encountered?
      options:
        - Keyboard navigation — cannot reach or operate a control with keyboard only
        - Screen reader — missing, incorrect, or confusing announcements
        - Focus management — focus jumps unexpectedly or is lost
        - Heading structure — headings skipped, missing, or in wrong order
        - Link / button labels — unlabeled, ambiguous, or "click here"
        - Color / contrast — text or controls are hard to distinguish
        - Images — missing or inadequate alternative text
        - Forms — fields not labeled or error messages not announced
        - Time limits — content changes or disappears before I can act

      placeholder: |
        When I press Tab on the Issues list page, focus skips the filter buttons
        and lands on the first issue title. I expected Tab to move to the filter
        buttons before the list.
