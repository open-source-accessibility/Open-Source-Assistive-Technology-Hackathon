# Learning Room Automation System

Complete automation infrastructure for the Learning Room workshop repository. Provides instant feedback, skill progression tracking, and automated peer pairing while preserving the educational value of human code review.

## 🎯 System Overview

This automation system transforms the Learning Room into a GitHub Skills-quality learning experience with three core components:

### 1. PR Validation Bot
**File:** `.github/workflows/learning-room-pr-bot.yml`

Automatically validates pull requests and provides educational feedback:
- Welcomes first-time contributors with orientation
- Checks PR requirements (issue reference, description)
- Validates file locations (learning-room only)
- Comprehensive accessibility checking:
  - Heading hierarchy (no H1→H3 skips)
  - Link text quality (no "click here")
  - Image alt text (required and descriptive)
  - Broken links detection
  - [TODO] markers (must be completed)
- Posts structured feedback comment with fixes
- Auto-applies labels (documentation, accessibility, needs-work)
- Responds to keywords (@bot help, "merge conflict", "request review")
- Creates commit status checks

**Validation Script:** `.github/scripts/validate-pr.js`  
**Triggers:** PR opened/edited/synchronized, comments created

### 2. Skills Progression Engine
**File:** `.github/workflows/skills-progression.yml`

Tracks student progress through leveled learning paths:
- Monitors merged PRs and counts completions
- Awards skill-specific badges:
  - 📝 Markdown Master
  - ♿ Accessibility Advocate
  - 👁️ Code Reviewer
  - 🤝 Team Player
  - 📚 Documentation Writer
  - 🏗️ Content Creator
- Unlocks new challenges by level:
  - Beginner (0+ PRs): Basic fixes
  - Intermediate (1+ PRs): Accessibility fundamentals
  - Advanced (3+ PRs): Reviews and mentorship
  - Expert (5+ PRs): Content creation
- Celebrates milestones (1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 merged PRs)
- Posts progress updates with stats

**Configuration:** `.github/data/challenge-progression.json`  
**Triggers:** PR merged (closed via merge)

### 3. Student Pairing & Grouping
**File:** `.github/workflows/student-grouping.yml`

Automates peer review assignment and study group formation:
- Assigns peer reviewers when PRs open
- Balances review load (least_reviews strategy)
- Provides review guidance to both parties
- Creates study groups (manual workflow dispatch):
  - Random shuffle
  - Skill-balanced (mix levels)
  - Timezone-matched
- Posts group coordination issues

**Configuration:** `.github/data/student-roster.json`  
**Triggers:** PR opened/ready_for_review, manual dispatch

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Facilitators (First Time Setup)

1. **Install files** (all workflows, scripts, data, docs)
2. **Update student roster** (`.github/data/student-roster.json`)
3. **Configure permissions** (Settings → Actions → Read/write + create PRs)
4. **Test with PR** (verify bot comments within 30 seconds)
5. **Create challenge issues** (pre-seed for workshop)

**See:** [Implementation Guide](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed setup

### For Students

When you open a PR:
1. Wait ~30 seconds for bot feedback
2. Read feedback carefully (structured by type)
3. Fix any issues bot identifies
4. Request human peer review
5. Respond to both bot and human feedback
6. Merge when approved!

**See:** [Automation Guide](../learning-room/AUTOMATION.md) for how to use the bot

## 🔧 Configuration

### Student Roster (`.github/data/student-roster.json`)

Update before each workshop cohort:

```json
{
  "cohort": "Workshop Name 2024",
  "facilitators": ["facilitator-username"],
  "students": [
    {
      "username": "github-username",
      "name": "Display Name",
      "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
      "interests": ["accessibility", "frontend"],
      "pronouns": "they/them",
      "screenReader": false,
      "mergedPRs": 0,
      "currentLevel": "Beginner",
      "badges": [],
      "joinedDate": "2024-01-15"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Skill Progression (`.github/data/challenge-progression.json`)

Defines levels, badges, and milestones. Default:
- **Beginner:** 0+ PRs (3 challenges)
- **Intermediate:** 1+ PRs (3 challenges)
- **Advanced:** 3+ PRs (3 challenges)
- **Expert:** 5+ PRs (3+ challenges)

Adjust PR thresholds and challenge lists as needed.

### Validation Rules (`.github/scripts/validate-pr.js`)

Customize checks:
- `checkIssueReference()` — Require issue link patterns
- `checkDescription()` — Minimum character count (default: 50)
- `checkFileLocation()` — Allowed directories (default: learning-room/)
- `validateMarkdownAccessibility()` — A11y rules (headings, links, alt text)

Add new validation functions to `required` or `suggestions` arrays.

## 🎓 Educational Philosophy

### Why Automation + Human Review?

**Automation provides:**
- ⚡ Instant feedback (no waiting for humans)
- 📚 Educational resources (links to learning)
- ✅ Consistency (same standards for all)
- 🤖 Unlimited patience (runs on every commit)

**Human review provides:**
- 💡 Creative suggestions (beyond rules)
- 🧠 Contextual judgment (nuanced understanding)
- 🤝 Social learning (building relationships)
- ❤️ Encouragement and mentorship

**Together:** Students experience professional CI/CD workflows while building community connections.

### Accessibility-First Design

All automation components:
- Use semantic Markdown (proper headings, lists, links)
- Include descriptive link text (never "click here")
- Provide clear, actionable feedback
- Link to resources for learning
- Work fully with screen readers
- Mention screen reader considerations in guidance

---

## 🔍 Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### Check Automation Health

**Actions Tab:**
- Verify workflows run on expected triggers
- Check for failed runs (red X)
- Review logs for errors

**PR Checks:**
- Bot comment appears within 30 seconds
- Labels applied automatically
- Status checks visible
- Keyword responses work

**Common Issues:**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Bot not commenting | Check workflow permissions (read/write + create PRs) |
| Validation errors wrong | Test script locally, check file paths |
| Skills not unlocking | Verify PR was merged (not just closed) |
| Reviewer not assigned | Check student roster has enough students |

**See:** [Implementation Guide - Troubleshooting](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md#step-7-troubleshooting)

## 📊 Success Metrics

Track these to evaluate automation impact:

**Engagement:**
- Number of PRs opened
- Merge rate (opened → merged)
- Time to first contribution
- Repeat contributions (students opening multiple PRs)

**Learning:**
- Bot feedback comprehension (ask students)
- Issues fixed after bot feedback
- Quality of peer reviews
- Accessibility improvements over time

**Efficiency:**
- Time to first feedback (bot vs human)
- Facilitator time spent on reviews
- Number of PRs requiring facilitator intervention
- Student satisfaction with automation

## 🎨 Customization Examples

### Add New Badge

Edit `.github/data/challenge-progression.json`:

```json

    help: "Code blocks improve documentation clarity"
  };
}

// Add to suggestions array
```

### Change Skill Level Thresholds

Edit `.github/data/challenge-progression.json`:

```json
{
  "levels": [
    { "name": "Beginner", "requiredPRs": 0 },
