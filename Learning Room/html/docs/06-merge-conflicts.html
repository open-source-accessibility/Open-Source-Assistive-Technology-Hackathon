    <h1>Merge Conflicts</h1>
<h2>Understanding, Preventing, and Resolving Conflicts</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Merge conflicts sound intimidating but are a normal, manageable part of collaborative development. This guide explains what conflicts are, how to read conflict markers, and how to resolve them — step by step.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>What Is a Merge Conflict?</h2>
<p>A merge conflict occurs when two people have both changed the <strong>same part of the same file</strong> in <strong>different ways</strong>, and Git cannot automatically decide which version is correct.</p>
<p>Git can merge changes automatically when they touch different parts of a file. Conflicts only happen when two changes overlap — for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Person A changed line 12 to say &quot;Submit form&quot;</li>
<li>Person B changed line 12 to say &quot;Send message&quot;</li>
<li>Git asks: which one do you want to keep?</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Why Conflicts Happen</h2>
<p>The most common causes:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Cause</th>
<th>Example</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Two people edited the same line</td>
<td>You both fixed the same typo differently</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>One person deleted a file but another edited it</td>
<td>You removed an old function; they fixed a bug in it</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Two people restructured the same section</td>
<td>You reorganized a list; they added items to it</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A long-running PR diverged from main</td>
<td>Your branch is weeks old and main has changed significantly</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<hr>
<h2>How to Prevent Conflicts (Prevention is Easier Than Resolution)</h2>
<p>Avoiding conflicts in the first place saves time and reduces stress. Here are the most effective strategies:</p>
<h3>1. <strong>Keep your branches short-lived</strong></h3>
<p>Work in small, focused chunks. A branch that lives for 3 days has far fewer conflicts than one that lives for 3 weeks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Target: 1-3 days from branch to merge</li>
<li>If a feature takes longer, break it into smaller PRs</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. <strong>Sync with main frequently</strong></h3>
<p>The longer your branch diverges from main, the more likely conflicts become.</p>
<p><strong>Best practice:</strong> Sync daily if main is active:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># From your feature branch:
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
# Or: git rebase origin/main (if comfortable with rebasing)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>GitHub web method:</strong> Use the &quot;Update branch&quot; button on your PR if it appears.</p>
<h3>3. <strong>Communicate with your team</strong></h3>
<p>Let others know what files you&#39;re working on. Use issue comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Heads up: I&#39;m refactoring <code>auth.js</code> in my PR for #42. If you&#39;re touching that file, let&#39;s coordinate.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prevents two people from heavily editing the same file simultaneously.</p>
<h3>4. <strong>Avoid mass reformatting</strong></h3>
<p>Running a formatter on an entire file creates conflicts with anyone else editing that file. If you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do it in a <strong>separate PR</strong> before functional changes</li>
<li>Announce it to the team</li>
<li>Merge it quickly so everyone can sync</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. <strong>Pull before you push</strong></h3>
<p>Always fetch and merge (or pull) before pushing your changes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git pull origin main  # Sync your local main
git checkout your-branch
git merge main        # Merge main into your branch
git push              # Now push
</code></pre>
<p>This catches conflicts locally where they&#39;re easier to resolve.</p>
<h3>6. <strong>Work on separate files when possible</strong></h3>
<p>If multiple people are working simultaneously, divide tasks by files or modules rather than everyone touching the same code.</p>
<h3>7. <strong>Keep PRs small</strong></h3>
<p>A 50-file PR will almost certainly conflict with something. A 5-file PR merges quickly and cleanly.</p>
<p>The most effective contributors make many small PRs rather than one giant one.</p>
<h3>8. <strong>Use Draft PRs for early visibility</strong></h3>
<p>Open your PR as a draft while still working. Others can see what you&#39;re changing and avoid overlapping work. Convert to &quot;Ready for review&quot; when done.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Advanced Prevention: Understanding Fast-Forward Merges</h2>
<p>When your branch is perfectly up to date with main and adds new commits on top, GitHub can do a &quot;fast-forward&quot; merge — main simply moves forward to your latest commit. No merge commit needed. No possibility of conflicts.</p>
<p><strong>How to achieve this:</strong> Rebase your branch on main right before merging:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git checkout your-branch
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
git push --force-with-lease  # See warning below about force pushing
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Force pushing rewrites history. Only do this on branches you alone control (not shared branches). Never force push to <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>For more on force pushing and rebasing, see the <a href="appendix-a-glossary.md#force-push">Glossary</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>When Conflicts Are Actually Good</h2>
<p>Conflicts indicate that multiple people are actively improving the project. In a healthy, collaborative environment, occasional conflicts are normal and manageable.</p>
<p>If you never have conflicts, it might mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>You&#39;re the only contributor (less review, less learning)</li>
<li>PRs are moving too slowly (stagnation)</li>
<li>People are avoiding working on important files (technical debt)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The goal isn&#39;t zero conflicts.</strong> The goal is catching them early, resolving them cleanly, and learning patterns that reduce future conflicts.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Spotting a Conflict on GitHub</h2>
<p>When a PR has a merge conflict, you will see this message on the Conversation tab, near the merge section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This branch has conflicts that must be resolved&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will also see a &quot;Resolve conflicts&quot; button. If you cannot see it (it may require write access), contact the PR author.</p>
<p><strong>Screen reader navigation to find this message:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Step 1: Press D to reach the bottom of the Conversation tab
Step 2: Navigate down with H or ↓ past the comment threads
Step 3: Find the heading or region containing &quot;This branch has conflicts&quot;
Step 4: B to find the &quot;Resolve conflicts&quot; button → Enter
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>Conflict Markers — What They Mean</h2>
<p>When conflict markers appear in a file, your editor is showing you both versions of the conflicted content so you can choose. The format is always:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
The content that is on YOUR current branch
=======
The content coming from the OTHER branch (or main)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; branch-name-or-commit-hash
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</code> — the start of YOUR version (HEAD = &quot;the branch you are currently on&quot;)</li>
<li><code>=======</code> — the dividing line between the two versions</li>
<li><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; branch-name</code> — the end of the INCOMING version (from the branch being merged in)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example in a real file</h3>
<p><strong>Original file (before conflict):</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;button&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>
<h1><strong>After two conflicting changes:</strong>
```
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
<button aria-label="Submit form">Submit</button></h1>
<p><button type="submit">Send message</button></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>feature/form-improvements</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>
**Resolution options:**
1. Keep your version: `&lt;button aria-label=&quot;Submit form&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;`
2. Keep their version: `&lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Send message&lt;/button&gt;`
3. Keep both changes: `&lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot; aria-label=&quot;Submit form&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;` ← often the right answer

## Resolving Conflicts on GitHub (Web Editor)

GitHub has a built-in conflict editor that you can use without any local tools.

### Step-by-step: GitHub Conflict Editor
</code></pre>
<p>Step 1: Navigate to your PR Conversation tab
Step 2: Find the merge conflict section (navigate down with ↓ or H)
Step 3: Find the &quot;Resolve conflicts&quot; button (B → Enter)<br>  → GitHub opens the conflict editor — a full-page text editor</p>
<p>Step 4: The editor shows the file(s) with conflicts
  → Navigate between conflicted files using the file list on the left
  → NVDA+F7 (or VO+U) to find the file navigation panel</p>
<p>Step 5: Switch to Focus Mode (NVDA+Space) to enter the text editor</p>
<p>Step 6: Read the conflict markers:
  → Navigate line by line with ↓
  → Find &quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD&quot; — this marks the start
  → The dividing line is &quot;=======&quot;
  → &quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; branch-name&quot; marks the end</p>
<p>Step 7: Edit the file to your desired result:
  → Delete the conflict markers (the &lt;&lt;&lt;, ===, &gt;&gt;&gt; lines)
  → Keep only the lines you want in the final version
  → Do not leave any conflict markers in the file</p>
<p>Step 8: After editing all conflicts in this file:
  → Tab to &quot;Mark as resolved&quot; button → Enter</p>
<p>Step 9: Repeat for all conflicted files</p>
<p>Step 10: Tab to &quot;Commit merge&quot; button → Enter
  → GitHub creates a merge commit and the PR can proceed</p>
<pre><code>
### What it looks like in the editor

When the conflict editor opens, your screen reader will announce a text editor. In Focus Mode, navigate with arrow keys. The content reads:
</code></pre>
<p>&lt;  &lt;  &lt;  &lt;  &lt;  &lt;  &lt;  H  E  A  D
<button aria-label="Submit form">Submit</button>
=  =  =  =  =  =  =
<button type="submit">Send message</button></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p> f  e  a  t  u  r  e  /  f  o  r  m - i  m  p  r  o  v  e  m  e  n  t  s</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>
*(Note: screen readers may spell out the `&lt;` and `&gt;` characters letter by letter — this is normal)*

## Resolving Conflicts in VS Code (Day 2)

VS Code has excellent merge conflict tooling with full screen reader support. This is covered in depth in [Git &amp; Source Control in VS Code](12-git-source-control.md), but here is an overview:

### VS Code shows conflicts as:
</code></pre>
<h1>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD (Current Change)
Your version
||||||| original                   ← (3-way merge, if enabled)
Original version before both edits</h1>
<p>Incoming version</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>branch-name (Incoming Change)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>
### VS Code merge conflict actions

When your cursor is on a conflict region, VS Code shows **CodeLens action links** above the conflict:
- &quot;Accept Current Change&quot; — keeps HEAD version
- &quot;Accept Incoming Change&quot; — keeps the branch version
- &quot;Accept Both Changes&quot; — keeps both (stacked)
- &quot;Compare Changes&quot; — shows a side-by-side diff

**Screen reader navigation in VS Code:**
</code></pre>
<p>Step 1: Open the conflicted file
Step 2: ↓ Arrow to navigate to a conflict marker (&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;)
Step 3: The CodeLens links appear above — press Tab to reach them
Step 4: Press Enter on your chosen action
Step 5: Save the file (Ctrl+S)
Step 6: Stage the resolved file: Ctrl+Shift+G → find the file → Stage changes
Step 7: Commit the merge</p>
<pre><code>
**GitHub Copilot can help:** With the cursor in a conflict region, open Copilot Chat (`Ctrl+Alt+I`) and type: &quot;Resolve this merge conflict — keep meaningful changes from both sides.&quot; Copilot will suggest a resolution that you can review and accept.

## When You Feel Stuck

### Ask for help — it&#39;s normal

If you are unsure which version to keep:
1. Leave a comment on the PR: &quot;I have a merge conflict in `filename.js` and I&#39;m not sure which version to keep — could someone help me understand the intent of these two changes?&quot;
2. Tag the PR author or a maintainer with `@username`

### Abandon and start fresh (nuclear option)

If a conflict is severe (the branch diverged a lot from main):
1. Close the PR without merging
2. Start a new branch from the latest `main`
3. Apply only your intended changes to the new branch
4. Open a new PR

This is legitimate — not a failure.

---

## Reading a Conflict Message from Git (Command Line Reference)

If you work locally, `git merge` or `git pull` will say:
</code></pre>
<p>CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/index.html
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</p>
<pre><code>
And `git status` will show:
</code></pre>
<p>both modified: src/index.html</p>
<pre><code>
These are normal outputs. The conflict markers are inserted into the file by Git — open the file and follow the steps above.

---

## Summary Checklist
</code></pre>
<p>Before you start:
  □ My PR is small and focused (fewer conflicts = easier life)
  □ I checked that others aren&#39;t editing the same files</p>
<p>When you see a conflict:
  □ Don&#39;t panic — conflicts are normal
  □ Read both versions (between &lt;&lt;&lt; and ===, and between === and &gt;&gt;&gt;)
  □ Decide: keep one, keep both, or combine intelligently
  □ Remove ALL three conflict marker lines (&lt;&lt;&lt;, ===, &gt;&gt;&gt;)
  □ Verify the final file makes sense
  □ Mark as resolved → Commit merge</p>
<p>After resolving:
  □ Re-check that the PR description and issue link are still accurate
  □ Comment on the PR: &quot;Resolved merge conflict — kept both the aria-label and type attribute&quot;
  □ Request re-review if reviewers already approved before the conflict was introduced</p>
<pre><code>

&gt; ### 🔥 Day 2 Amplifier — Copilot Chat &amp; Conflict Prevention
&gt;
&gt; **Resolve at least one conflict completely by hand before using any AI assistance.** You must be able to read `&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;`, `=======`, and `&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;` markers and understand what each version represents. An AI-suggested resolution you cannot independently verify is a liability — you are accepting a change you do not understand into a codebase other people depend on.
&gt;
&gt; Once you have mastered manual conflict resolution:
&gt; - **In VS Code** — Copilot Chat (`Ctrl+Shift+I`) can explain a conflict in plain language — *&quot;Person A renamed the button to &#39;Submit Form&#39;; Person B renamed it to &#39;Send Message&#39;. Which intent should take priority?&quot;* — but you decide what survives
&gt; - **In your repo** — Agent Forge&#39;s `@pr-review` can identify high-risk overlapping changes before a conflict occurs, flagging when two contributors are editing the same file area and giving you time to coordinate before it escalates
&gt; - **In the cloud** — GitHub Agentic Workflows can detect stale PRs diverging from `main` and automatically notify contributors with a suggested rebase checklist — preventing the conflict before it is ever introduced
&gt;
&gt; *Understanding conflict markers is not a stepping stone to letting AI handle conflicts. It is the skill that tells you when AI got it wrong.*
