<h2>1. What Is GitHub Actions?</h2>
<p><strong>GitHub Actions</strong> is GitHub&#39;s built-in automation system. It lets repository maintainers define automated tasks that run in response to things that happen in the repository — like someone opening a pull request, pushing a commit, or filing an issue.</p>
<p>Think of it as a robot assistant that every repository can optionally configure. That robot watches for specific events and then automatically runs jobs: testing code, checking spelling, scanning for accessibility issues, building documentation, deploying a website, and more.</p>
<p><strong>As a contributor, you do not need to write workflows.</strong> But you will see their results on nearly every pull request you open, and you need to understand what those results mean.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. Key Vocabulary</h2>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Term</th>
<th>What It Means</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><strong>Workflow</strong></td>
<td>A complete automated process defined in a YAML file. A repo can have many workflows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Job</strong></td>
<td>A group of steps that run together, usually on the same machine. A workflow can have multiple jobs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Step</strong></td>
<td>A single task within a job — running a command, calling an action, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Action</strong></td>
<td>A reusable unit of automation. Like a plugin. Many are shared publicly on <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions">GitHub Marketplace</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Runner</strong></td>
<td>The machine (virtual server) that executes a job. GitHub provides free runners.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Trigger / Event</strong></td>
<td>The thing that causes a workflow to start — a push, a PR, a schedule, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Status check</strong></td>
<td>The pass/fail result of a workflow shown on a pull request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Artifact</strong></td>
<td>A file produced by a workflow (a build output, a test report, etc.) that can be downloaded.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Secret</strong></td>
<td>An encrypted variable stored in a repo&#39;s settings — used in workflows without exposing sensitive values.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>YAML</strong></td>
<td>The file format used to write workflow files. Indentation matters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong><code>on:</code></strong></td>
<td>The YAML key that defines what triggers a workflow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong><code>runs-on:</code></strong></td>
<td>The YAML key that specifies the runner OS (<code>ubuntu-latest</code>, <code>windows-latest</code>, <code>macos-latest</code>).</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<hr>
<h2>3. Where Workflows Live in a Repository</h2>
<p>Workflow files live in a specific, mandatory location:</p>
<pre><code>your-repository/
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        ├── ci.yml              ← Runs tests on every push/PR
        ├── lint.yml            ← Checks code style
        ├── a11y-scan.yml       ← Accessibility scanning
        └── deploy.yml          ← Deploys the site when code merges to main
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>.github/</code> folder is hidden by convention (starts with a dot). To find it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On GitHub.com:</strong> The file browser shows it — use <code>T</code> (go to file) or navigate the file table with <code>Ctrl+Alt+Arrow</code> keys</li>
<li><strong>In VS Code:</strong> It appears in the Explorer panel — enable &quot;Show Hidden Files&quot; if needed</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Screen reader tip:</strong> The <code>.github</code> folder reads as &quot;dot github.&quot; The <code>workflows</code> folder is inside it. File names ending in <code>.yml</code> are YAML workflow files.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>4. The Anatomy of a Workflow File</h2>
<p>Here is a simple, real workflow file. You do not need to write this, but you should be able to read it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># .github/workflows/ci.yml

name: CI                          # The display name shown in the Actions tab

on:                               # What triggers this workflow
  push:
    branches: [main]              # Run when code is pushed to main
  pull_request:                   # Run when a PR is opened or updated
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:                           # The job name (shown in status checks)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest        # What operating system to use
    steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4 # A reusable action — downloads your repo code

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: &#39;20&#39;

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install          # A shell command

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test             # Another shell command
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Reading this:</strong> The workflow named &quot;CI&quot; runs when code is pushed to <code>main</code> or a PR targets <code>main</code>. It creates one job called <code>test</code> that runs on Linux. That job checks out the code, installs Node.js, installs dependencies, and runs the test suite.</p>
<p>If <code>npm test</code> exits with an error, the job fails, and that failure shows up as a red ❌ on your pull request.</p>
<hr>
<h2>5. What Triggers a Workflow</h2>
<p>The most common triggers you will encounter as a contributor:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Trigger</th>
<th>What Causes It</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><code>push</code></td>
<td>Any commit pushed to a branch</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>pull_request</code></td>
<td>A PR is opened, updated, synchronized, or reopened</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>pull_request_review</code></td>
<td>A review is submitted on a PR</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>issue_comment</code></td>
<td>A comment is posted on an issue or PR</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>schedule</code></td>
<td>A recurring timer (like a cron job) — e.g., every Monday at 9am</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>workflow_dispatch</code></td>
<td>A manual trigger — someone activates a button in the Actions tab</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>release</code></td>
<td>When a new release is published</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>merge_group</code></td>
<td>When a PR enters a merge queue</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>The most important one for you:</strong> <code>pull_request</code> — this is what triggers checks on your PR.</p>
<hr>
<h2>6. Understanding Status Checks on Pull Requests</h2>
<p>When you open a pull request on a repo that uses GitHub Actions, you will see a section near the bottom of the <strong>Conversation tab</strong> called <strong>checks</strong> or <strong>status checks</strong>.</p>
<h3>What the status indicators mean</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Symbol</th>
<th>Color</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
<th>What to do</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>● spinning</td>
<td>Yellow/Orange</td>
<td>Checks are running — wait</td>
<td>Wait for them to complete</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✓ checkmark</td>
<td>Green</td>
<td>All required checks passed</td>
<td>Good — you may be able to merge</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>✗ cross</td>
<td>Red</td>
<td>One or more checks failed</td>
<td>Do not merge — read the failure</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>⊘</td>
<td>Grey</td>
<td>Check was skipped</td>
<td>Usually fine — skipped by design</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>⚠</td>
<td>Yellow</td>
<td>Non-blocking warning</td>
<td>Review but may not block merge</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<h3>Navigating status checks with a screen reader</h3>
<p><strong>NVDA / JAWS (browse mode):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Open the pull request Conversation tab</li>
<li>Navigate to the section heading for &quot;checks&quot; using <code>H</code> or <code>2</code></li>
<li>Each check result is announced as a link or button with its name and status</li>
<li>Press <code>Enter</code> on a failed check to expand its details</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>VoiceOver (macOS, Safari):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Use <code>VO+U</code> to open the Rotor</li>
<li>Select &quot;Headings&quot; and navigate to the checks section</li>
<li>Use <code>VO+Arrow</code> to read through check results</li>
<li>Activate a check link with <code>VO+Space</code></li>
</ol>
<h3>Required vs. non-required checks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Required checks</strong> must pass before a PR can be merged. A maintainer configures which checks are required in Branch Protection Rules.</li>
<li><strong>Non-required checks</strong> are informational — a failure shown in grey/yellow usually won&#39;t block a merge.</li>
<li>If you&#39;re not sure whether a check is required, look for the phrase <strong>&quot;Required&quot;</strong> next to the check name.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>7. Reading the Actions Tab with a Screen Reader</h2>
<p>The <strong>Actions tab</strong> of a repository shows the history of all workflow runs. You can use it to see what ran, what failed, and why.</p>
<h3>Getting to the Actions tab</h3>
<ol>
<li>Open the repository</li>
<li>Navigate to the &quot;Repository navigation&quot; landmark (<code>D</code> on NVDA/JAWS)</li>
<li>Find the &quot;Actions&quot; tab link and activate it (<code>Enter</code>)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Navigating workflow runs (NVDA/JAWS browse mode)</h3>
<pre><code>Key          Action
H            Jump between section headings
3            Jump between workflow run headings (they are h3)
Tab          Move between interactive elements (links, buttons)
Enter        Open a workflow run to see details
</code></pre>
<h3>Navigating workflow runs (VoiceOver macOS)</h3>
<pre><code>Key                  Action
VO+U → Headings      Open rotor and navigate by heading
VO+Right/Left        Read next/previous item
VO+Space             Activate a link or button
</code></pre>
<h3>Reading a run&#39;s details</h3>
<p>When you open a workflow run, you see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Job names listed on the left (or in a sidebar)</li>
<li>Steps listed within each job</li>
<li>Green checkmarks (passed) or red X marks (failed) next to each step</li>
</ul>
<p>To find out <strong>why a step failed:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the failed step</li>
<li>Activate it to expand the log output</li>
<li>The log is a large text area — switch to focus mode to read it</li>
<li>Look for lines containing <code>Error:</code>, <code>FAILED</code>, <code>exit code</code>, or <code>AssertionError</code></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Log output can be very long. Use your screen reader&#39;s search (<code>NVDA+Ctrl+F</code>, <code>JAWS: Insert+F</code>, <code>VO+F</code>) to search for &quot;error&quot; or &quot;failed&quot; to jump directly to the problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>8. Common Workflows You Will Encounter</h2>
<p>As you contribute to open source repositories, you will see these types of workflows regularly:</p>
<h3>Continuous Integration (CI)</h3>
<p><strong>What it does:</strong> Runs the project&#39;s test suite automatically every time code changes.</p>
<p><strong>What you see:</strong> A check called &quot;CI&quot;, &quot;Tests&quot;, &quot;Build&quot;, or similar.</p>
<p><strong>If it fails:</strong> Your code change may have broken one or more tests. Read the error message in the job log, or ask the maintainer if it is a pre-existing failure.</p>
<h3>Linting / Code Style</h3>
<p><strong>What it does:</strong> Checks that code follows the project&#39;s formatting and style rules — things like indentation, line length, or consistent import ordering.</p>
<p><strong>What you see:</strong> A check called &quot;Lint&quot;, &quot;ESLint&quot;, &quot;Prettier&quot;, &quot;Flake8&quot;, or similar.</p>
<p><strong>If it fails:</strong> Usually means a formatting rule was violated. The log will tell you exactly which file and line. Many projects include a command to auto-fix this (e.g., <code>npm run lint:fix</code>).</p>
<h3>Spelling / Documentation Checks</h3>
<p><strong>What it does:</strong> Checks documentation files for spelling errors, broken links, or formatting issues.</p>
<p><strong>What you see:</strong> A check called &quot;Spell Check&quot;, &quot;markdownlint&quot;, &quot;Link Check&quot;, or similar.</p>
<p><strong>If it fails:</strong> There is a typo or formatting issue in a doc file. Very common on documentation-only contributions.</p>
<h3>Accessibility Scanning</h3>
<p><strong>What it does:</strong> Runs automated accessibility checks against HTML output or component libraries to catch WCAG violations.</p>
<p><strong>What you see:</strong> A check called &quot;a11y&quot;, &quot;Accessibility&quot;, &quot;axe&quot;, &quot;pa11y&quot;, or similar.</p>
<p><strong>If it fails:</strong> An accessibility problem was introduced. The log will describe the failing rule (e.g., &quot;Image missing alt text&quot;, &quot;Color contrast insufficient&quot;). This is extremely valuable information and exactly the kind of thing this community cares about.</p>
<h3>Security Scanning</h3>
<p><strong>What it does:</strong> Scans for known vulnerabilities in dependencies or exposed secrets.</p>
<p><strong>What you see:</strong> A check called &quot;CodeQL&quot;, &quot;Dependabot&quot;, &quot;Snyk&quot;, or similar.</p>
<p><strong>If it fails:</strong> A security issue was detected — inform the maintainer and do not merge.</p>
<h3>Deployment / Preview Builds</h3>
<p><strong>What it does:</strong> Builds and deploys a preview version of a website or app from your PR branch.</p>
<p><strong>What you see:</strong> A bot comment on your PR with a preview URL, and a check called &quot;Deploy&quot;, &quot;Netlify&quot;, &quot;Vercel&quot;, &quot;GitHub Pages&quot;, or similar.</p>
<p><strong>What it gives you:</strong> A live preview of what the site will look like with your changes — very useful for visual review and for accessibility testing with your screen reader on the actual rendered output.</p>
<hr>
<h2>9. What To Do When a Check Fails</h2>
<p>This happens to every contributor. It is normal. Here is your step-by-step process:</p>
<h3>Step 1: Don&#39;t panic</h3>
<p>A failing check is information, not a judgment. It is the system telling you something specific needs attention.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Navigate to the failed check</h3>
<p>From your PR&#39;s Conversation tab:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scroll down to the checks section (press <code>D</code> to reach the &quot;Checks&quot; region if using a screen reader)</li>
<li>Find the failing check (red ✗)</li>
<li>Press <code>Enter</code> on &quot;Details&quot; (or the check name itself) to open the workflow run</li>
</ol>
<h3>Step 3: Find the failing step</h3>
<p>In the workflow run:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look for the step with the red ✗ marker</li>
<li>Press <code>Enter</code> or <code>Space</code> to expand the log output</li>
</ol>
<h3>Step 4: Read the error message</h3>
<p>Look for:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Error:</code> — describes what went wrong</li>
<li><code>FAILED</code> or <code>FAIL</code> — test failure summary</li>
<li>File name and line number — where exactly the problem is</li>
<li><code>exit code 1</code> (or non-zero) — the command failed</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 5: Fix the issue locally (or in the web editor)</h3>
<p>Common fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Test failure:</strong> Understand what the test expects and whether your change broke something intentional</li>
<li><strong>Lint failure:</strong> Run the project&#39;s format/lint command, or manually fix the flagged lines</li>
<li><strong>Spell check failure:</strong> Fix the typo noted in the log</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility failure:</strong> Fix the specific a11y violation described (missing alt text, contrast issue, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 6: Commit and push the fix</h3>
<ul>
<li>The workflow will automatically re-run when you push new commits to the branch</li>
<li>No need to close and re-open the PR</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 7: If you&#39;re stuck</h3>
<p>It is completely acceptable to comment on your PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The CI check is failing on [step name]. I&#39;ve read the error log and I&#39;m not sure how to fix [specific issue]. Could a maintainer point me in the right direction?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Asking for help is not weakness. It is collaboration.</p>
<hr>
<h2>10. Workflow Permissions and Security</h2>
<h3>Why some workflows need your approval</h3>
<p>If you are contributing to a repository for the first time, GitHub may hold your workflow runs for approval. You will see a message like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Workflows aren&#39;t being run on this pull request. A maintainer must approve this.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a <strong>security feature</strong> — it prevents malicious code from running on the maintainer&#39;s infrastructure before they have reviewed it. Do not be alarmed. Simply add a comment like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Ready for review. Could a maintainer approve the workflow runs?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What you should never do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Never change workflow files to bypass checks (e.g., deleting tests to make them pass)</li>
<li>Never add secrets or credentials to workflow files or code</li>
<li>Never approve a workflow run on someone else&#39;s PR unless you have reviewed the code</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dependabot</h3>
<p><strong>Dependabot</strong> is an automated bot built into GitHub that creates pull requests to update outdated or vulnerable dependencies. You will see PRs in a repository from a user called <code>dependabot[bot]</code>. These are automated, not from a person. Maintainers typically review and merge these. As a contributor, you usually don&#39;t need to interact with them, but it is good to know they exist.</p>
<hr>
<h2>11. Accessibility-Focused Workflows</h2>
<p>This is relevant to our event specifically. The open source accessibility community actively uses GitHub Actions to <strong>automatically catch accessibility regressions</strong> — meaning, to ensure that new code does not introduce new accessibility barriers.</p>
<h3>GitHub&#39;s Accessibility Scanner Action</h3>
<p>GitHub itself has open-sourced an <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/accessibility-scanner">AI-powered Accessibility Scanner</a> that can be added to a repository. It uses AI to find, file, and help fix accessibility bugs using GitHub Copilot.</p>
<p>A basic workflow using it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">name: Accessibility Scan

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  a11y:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Accessibility Scanner
        uses: github/accessibility-scanner@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
</code></pre>
<h3>Common tools used in a11y workflows</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Tool</th>
<th>What It Checks</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core">axe-core</a></td>
<td>WCAG violations in HTML/rendered pages</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://pa11y.org/">pa11y</a></td>
<td>Automated accessibility testing against URLs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://github.com/nickcolley/jest-axe">jest-axe</a></td>
<td>axe checks inside unit tests</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci">Lighthouse CI</a></td>
<td>Accessibility + performance scoring</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="https://github.com/IBMa/equal-access">IBM Equal Access Checker</a></td>
<td>WCAG 2.1 / 2.2 compliance checking</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>What these tools catch (and what they do not):</strong></p>
<p>Automated tools catch approximately <strong>30–40% of accessibility issues</strong> — things like missing alt attributes, insufficient color contrast ratios, or unlabeled form fields. The remaining issues require human testing, especially with actual assistive technology like your screen reader.</p>
<p>This is precisely why <strong>manual testing by people who use screen readers is so valuable and irreplaceable.</strong></p>
<h3>Preparing the Environment for GitHub-Hosted Agents</h3>
<p>When custom agents run on GitHub.com — triggered by an issue assignment or a Copilot Chat task — they need any external tools pre-installed before they start working. GitHub recognizes a special setup workflow for this: a workflow file with a single job named <code>copilot-setup-steps</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong> <code>.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">name: Copilot Setup Steps

on: workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  copilot-setup-steps:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: &#39;20&#39;

      - name: Install accessibility testing tools
        run: npm install -g @axe-core/cli markdownlint-cli2
</code></pre>
<p><strong>What this does:</strong> Before a Copilot coding agent begins working, GitHub runs this job to prepare the environment. Without it, an agent that needs <code>markdownlint-cli2</code> (for the Markdown Accessibility Assistant) or <code>@axe-core/cli</code> (for WCAG scanning) will fail because those tools are not present.</p>
<p><strong>The job name <code>copilot-setup-steps</code> is required</strong> — GitHub won&#39;t recognize any other name for agent environment preparation.</p>
<p><strong>Connection to Section 13 of the VS Code guide:</strong> This is the infrastructure that enables Scope 3 (cloud execution) of the three-layer Agent Forge model. The same agent you run in VS Code with <code>@markdown-accessibility-assistant</code> can run on GitHub.com automatically — but only if the environment is prepared with this workflow.</p>

<h2>12. Hands-On Activity</h2>
<h3>Activity: Explore a Workflow in This Repository</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Practice navigating the Actions tab and reading a workflow file using your screen reader.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <code>learning-room</code> repository on GitHub</li>
<li>Go to the <strong>Actions tab</strong> (in the Repository navigation landmark)</li>
<li>Use <code>3</code> (NVDA/JAWS) or the Headings rotor (VoiceOver) to navigate the list of workflow runs</li>
<li>Open the most recent run</li>
<li>Find any failed step and expand its log</li>
<li>Navigate to the <code>.github/workflows/</code> folder via the Code tab</li>
<li>Open a workflow <code>.yml</code> file</li>
<li>Read through the file and identify:<ul>
<li>What event triggers it</li>
<li>What OS it runs on</li>
<li>How many steps it has</li>
<li>What the last step does</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Discussion questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What would happen if you opened a PR and the &quot;Accessibility Scan&quot; check failed?</li>
<li>Where would you look to find out what accessibility violation was detected?</li>
<li>If you disagreed with a failing lint check, what would be the appropriate way to raise that with a maintainer?</li>
</ul>

<li>Setting up self-hosted runners</li>
<li>Creating custom Actions</li>
<li>Advanced workflow patterns (matrix builds, reusable workflows, environments)</li>
<li>Secrets management and OIDC authentication</li>

<h3>🔥 Day 2 Bridge — From Actions to Agentic Workflows</h3>
<p><strong>Understand standard YAML workflow files before engaging with agentic workflows.</strong> GitHub Agentic Workflows are not a separate technology — they are the next layer on top of what you learned here. They share the same trigger model, the same permissions system, and the same <code>.github/workflows/</code> directory. You cannot evaluate whether an agentic workflow is safe or correct unless you can already read a standard one.</p>
<p>The three layers, in sequence — each builds on the one before it:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Standard GitHub Actions</strong> — YAML files in <code>.github/workflows/</code>; define triggers and structured shell steps; what you mastered in this guide</li>
<li><strong>Agent Forge in VS Code</strong> — <code>.agent.md</code> files in <code>.github/agents/</code>; define behavior in plain English; GitHub Copilot Chat executes them on demand in your editor — same <code>.github/</code> folder, plain text, no YAML required</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Agentic Workflows in the cloud</strong> — <code>.md</code> files in <code>.github/workflows/</code>; define intent in plain Markdown frontmatter; a coding agent (Copilot CLI, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex) executes them inside GitHub Actions on any trigger — no VS Code, no local setup required</li>
</ol>
<p>All three live in <code>.github/</code>. All three are plain text. All three run on your behalf. The only difference is where they run and how sophisticated their executor is.</p>
<p><em>You cannot skip a layer. Each one only makes sense because you understand the one before it.</em></p>
