<h2>How to Be an Effective and Respectful Open Source Contributor</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Technical skills get your code into a project. Communication skills keep you welcomed in the community. This guide covers the human side of open source.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>GitHub Flow — The Standard Contribution Workflow</h2>
<p>Before diving into communication norms, it helps to understand the workflow that gives all of those conversations their context. <strong>GitHub Flow</strong> is the lightweight branching model recommended for open source contribution. It is simple by design and works whether you are making a one-line documentation fix or a major feature addition.</p>
<h3>The Six Steps of GitHub Flow</h3>
<pre><code>1. Create a branch
   └─ Branch off main with a descriptive name
      (e.g., fix/missing-alt-text, docs/update-contributing-guide)

2. Make your changes and commit
   └─ Work in small, logical commits with clear messages
      Each commit should represent one coherent, complete change

3. Open a Pull Request
   └─ Share your work early — even as a Draft PR
      Describe what you changed, why, and how to test it
      Link to the related issue (Closes #42)

4. Discuss and review
   └─ Reviewers leave feedback → you refine your work
      This is collaborative, not adversarial

5. Pass status checks
   └─ Automated tests and linting must pass
      The project&#39;s quality gates exist to protect everyone

6. Merge
   └─ A maintainer merges your PR into main
      The linked issue closes automatically
      Your contribution is now part of the project ✅
</code></pre>
<h3>Why This Model Works</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>main</code> is always deployable.</strong> Nothing goes into <code>main</code> directly — every change goes through a PR and review. This protects the project and all its users.</li>
<li><strong>Branches are cheap and disposable.</strong> Create a branch per task. Delete it after merging. There is no overhead to starting fresh.</li>
<li><strong>PRs are the unit of conversation.</strong> Everything about a change — the why, the tradeoffs, the review, the approval — lives in one place.</li>
<li><strong>Small changes move faster.</strong> A 5-file PR gets reviewed in an hour. A 50-file PR sits for days. The most effective contributors keep PRs small and focused.</li>
</ul>
<h3>GitHub Flow vs Git Flow</h3>
<p>You may encounter &quot;Git Flow&quot; in older projects or enterprise environments. It uses longer-lived branches (<code>develop</code>, <code>release/</code>, <code>hotfix/</code>) and is more complex. For open source contribution — especially at a hackathon — <strong>GitHub Flow is what you want</strong>. It is what GitHub itself uses and what most modern open source projects follow.</p>
<h3>The Unwritten Rule: One Thing Per Branch</h3>
<p>A branch and its PR should do <strong>one thing</strong>. If you are fixing a broken link and you notice a typo nearby, fix the typo in a <strong>separate branch and PR</strong>. This keeps reviews fast, history clean, and reduces the risk of one unrelated problem blocking an urgent fix.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Keeping Your Fork Up to Date</h2>
<p>When you fork a repository, you get a snapshot of the project at that moment. The original repository (called &quot;upstream&quot;) continues to evolve. To keep your fork current with upstream changes:</p>
<h3>Why Sync Your Fork?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stay compatible</strong> — upstream changes may affect your work</li>
<li><strong>Avoid conflicts</strong> — the longer you wait, the more conflicts you&#39;ll face when merging</li>
<li><strong>Get bug fixes</strong> — benefit from improvements made while you worked</li>
<li><strong>Keep branches clean</strong> — start new PRs from an up-to-date main branch</li>
</ul>
<h3>Method 1: GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to your fork&#39;s main page: <code>github.com/your-username/repo-name</code></li>
<li>Look for the sync indicator: &quot;This branch is X commits behind upstream/main&quot;</li>
<li>Select the <strong>&quot;Sync fork&quot;</strong> button</li>
<li>Select <strong>&quot;Update branch&quot;</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>GitHub merges the upstream changes into your fork automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Screen reader navigation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The sync button appears in the landmark containing the branch selector</li>
<li>After pressing <code>D</code> to reach this landmark, press <code>B</code> to cycle buttons until you hear &quot;Sync fork&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Method 2: Git Command Line (VS Code Terminal)</h3>
<p>If you&#39;re working locally in VS Code:</p>
<p><strong>One-time setup — add the upstream remote:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/repo-name.git
git remote -v  # Verify it was added
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Sync process:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># 1. Switch to your main branch
git checkout main

# 2. Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream

# 3. Merge upstream&#39;s main into yours
git merge upstream/main

# 4. Push the updated main to your fork on GitHub
git push origin main
</code></pre>
<p><strong>When to sync:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Before starting work on a new feature</li>
<li>Before submitting a PR (to ensure you&#39;re working off the latest code)</li>
<li>Periodically on long-running branches (weekly if actively developed)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Method 3: GitHub Desktop</h3>
<ol>
<li>Open GitHub Desktop</li>
<li>Select <strong>Repository → Pull</strong> to get your fork&#39;s latest</li>
<li>Select <strong>Branch → Merge into Current Branch</strong></li>
<li>Choose <strong>upstream/main</strong></li>
<li>Push the changes to your fork on GitHub</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Writing Good Commit Messages</h2>
<p>Every commit you make includes a message describing what changed. Good commit messages make project history understandable months or years later. They also show professionalism and consideration for future contributors (including yourself).</p>
<h3>The commit message format:</h3>
<pre><code>&lt;type&gt;: &lt;short summary in imperative mood&gt;

&lt;optional body: more detailed explanation&gt;

&lt;optional footer: references to issues&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3>The First Line (Required)</h3>
<p><strong>Keep it under 50 characters.</strong> This is the commit summary that appears in logs and GitHub&#39;s commit list. Think of it as an email subject line.</p>
<p><strong>Use the imperative mood:</strong> Write as if giving a command to the codebase.</p>
<p>✅ &quot;Fix broken link in README&quot;<br>✅ &quot;Add alt text to hero image&quot;<br>✅ &quot;Remove deprecated function&quot;  </p>
<p>❌ &quot;Fixed broken link&quot; — past tense<br>❌ &quot;Fixing broken link&quot; — gerund<br>❌ &quot;I fixed the broken link&quot; — too personal  </p>
<p><strong>Why imperative?</strong> It matches Git&#39;s autogen messages: &quot;Merge pull request #42&quot; or &quot;Revert commit abc123.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Optional prefixes</strong> (common in some projects):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fix:</code> — bug fix</li>
<li><code>feat:</code> — new feature</li>
<li><code>docs:</code> — documentation only</li>
<li><code>style:</code> — formatting, no code change</li>
<li><code>refactor:</code> — code restructuring</li>
<li><code>test:</code> — adding or updating tests</li>
<li><code>chore:</code> — maintenance (bump dependencies, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: <code>fix: correct ARIA label on submit button</code></p>
<h3>The Body (Optional)</h3>
<p>If the summary isn&#39;t enough, add a body explaining:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Why</strong> you made the change (more important than what)</li>
<li><strong>What</strong> trade-offs you considered</li>
<li><strong>How</strong> the change affects behavior</li>
</ul>
<p>Leave a blank line between the summary and the body.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>feat: add keyboard shortcuts for issue navigation

The previous interface required excessive tabbing to reach issue actions.
This change adds G+I to jump to issues list and C to comment inline.

Shortcuts follow GitHub&#39;s existing pattern (G+letter for navigation).
Tested with NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver.
</code></pre>
<h3>The Footer (Optional)</h3>
<p>Link commits to issues or PRs:</p>
<pre><code>Closes #42
Fixes #17
Part of #89
</code></pre>
<p>When the commit is merged, GitHub automatically closes linked issues.</p>
<h3>Atomic Commits</h3>
<p>Each commit should represent <strong>one logical change</strong>. Don&#39;t bundle unrelated fixes into a single commit.</p>
<p>✅ Good: One commit adds alt text; another fixes a typo<br>❌ Bad: One commit adds alt text, fixes a typo, reformats code, and updates dependencies  </p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> If a commit introduces a bug, you want to revert just that change—not everything.</p>
<h3>Common mistakes to avoid:</h3>
<ul>
<li>&quot;WIP&quot; or &quot;more changes&quot; — not descriptive</li>
<li>&quot;Update file.js&quot; — GitHub already knows that</li>
<li>&quot;Fixed it&quot; — doesn&#39;t say what &quot;it&quot; is</li>
<li>Commit messages filled with expletives or frustration</li>
<li>Extremely long summaries that get cut off in logs</li>
</ul>
<h3>Good commit messages in practice:</h3>
<pre><code>fix: prevent crash when username contains special characters

Previously, usernames with @ or # caused a parsing error in the
notification system. This escapes special characters before processing.

Fixes #142
</code></pre>
<pre><code>docs: add screen reader instructions to contribution guide

New section covers NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver setup for contributors
using assistive technology. Based on workshop feedback.

Part of #200
</code></pre>
<p><strong>When you make a habit of writing good commit messages, you build trust.</strong> Maintainers see that you care about the project&#39;s long-term health, not just your immediate contribution.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Nature of Open Source Communication</h2>
<p>Open source collaboration happens primarily <strong>in writing</strong>, <strong>asynchronously</strong>, <strong>in public</strong>. Understanding these three characteristics shapes everything about how we communicate.</p>
<h3>In writing</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is no tone of voice, body language, or immediate clarification</li>
<li>A message that sounds terse in your head may read as hostile to the reader</li>
<li>Sarcasm and irony are nearly impossible to convey safely — avoid them</li>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> Be explicit. &quot;I think this might cause a problem because...&quot; is clearer than &quot;This is problematic.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Asynchronously</h3>
<ul>
<li>Comments are not instant messages — the reader may see your post hours or days later</li>
<li>You may be in a rush; they are not receiving urgency from your message</li>
<li>Comments exist without the context of what you were thinking when you wrote them</li>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> Provide all necessary context in every message. Do not assume continuity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>In public</h3>
<ul>
<li>Everything you write is visible to everyone, forever, and may be indexed and shared</li>
<li>Future contributors, employers, and the broader community will read your words</li>
<li>A dismissive reply to a beginner casts a shadow on the entire project</li>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> Write as if your most supportive and most critical reader are both watching.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>The Anatomy of Helpful Feedback</h2>
<p>Whether commenting on an issue, reviewing a PR, or responding to a question, effective feedback has a structure:</p>
<h3>1. Acknowledge what&#39;s working</h3>
<p>Before identifying problems, name what is good. This is not flattery — it is accuracy. Most contributions have real strengths.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The approach of separating the icon from the button text is exactly right — makes the screen reader label much cleaner.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>2. Identify the specific concern</h3>
<p>Be precise. Vague feedback is not actionable.</p>
<p>❌ &quot;This code is inaccessible.&quot;<br>✅ &quot;This button has no accessible name — <code>aria-label</code> or visible text is needed for screen readers to announce its purpose.&quot;</p>
<h3>3. Explain why it matters</h3>
<p>Context turns a complaint into a lesson. It also respects the contributor — they deserve to understand, not just comply.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Without an accessible name, screen readers will announce the button as simply &#39;button,&#39; which gives the user no information about what activating it will do.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>4. Suggest a path forward (when you can)</h3>
<p>If you have an idea for a solution, offer it as a suggestion, not a mandate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Something like <code>aria-label=&#39;Close navigation menu&#39;</code> would work well here. Happy to help if you&#39;d like.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>5. Signal the weight of the concern</h3>
<p>Help contributors understand what is a blocker versus a preference.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nit:</code> — minor, optional suggestion (&quot;nit: there&#39;s a trailing space here&quot;)</li>
<li>No qualifier — normal concern, should be addressed</li>
<li>&quot;This is a blocker because...&quot;  — must be fixed before merge</li>
<li>&quot;Just a thought, not a blocker...&quot; — feedback but no requirement</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Language and Tone</h2>
<h3>Prefer &quot;we&quot; or describe the code, not the person</h3>
<p>❌ &quot;You made an error here.&quot;<br>✅ &quot;There&#39;s an error here.&quot; or &quot;This line does X but we need Y.&quot;</p>
<h3>Use tentative language for uncertainty</h3>
<p>❌ &quot;This will crash on mobile.&quot;<br>✅ &quot;I think this might cause issues on mobile — have you tested with a narrower viewport?&quot;</p>
<h3>Acknowledge cultural and language diversity</h3>
<p>Open source is global. Contributors may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing in their second or third language</li>
<li>Unfamiliar with idioms (&quot;it&#39;s a no-brainer,&quot; &quot;hit the ground running,&quot; &quot;over the top&quot;)</li>
<li>Accustomed to different norms of directness</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When reading someone&#39;s comment:</strong> Assume good intent unless there is clear evidence otherwise.<br><strong>When writing:</strong> Choose plain words over clever ones.</p>
<h3>Avoid urgency markers unless genuinely urgent</h3>
<p>❌ &quot;I need this fixed ASAP&quot;<br>✅ &quot;This is blocking our release scheduled for next Friday — is there capacity to look at it this week?&quot;</p>
<hr>
<h2>Commenting Etiquette</h2>
<h3>Keep comments focused</h3>
<p>Each comment should address one concern. If you have three issues, leave three comments — unless they are closely related.</p>
<h3>Don&#39;t leave comments unresolved</h3>
<p>If you asked a question and got an answer, respond. &quot;Thanks, that makes sense&quot; or resolving the conversation thread signals that the thread is complete.</p>
<h3>Resolving conversations</h3>
<p>On a PR, conversations (inline comment threads) can be &quot;resolved&quot; once addressed. The author of the change and the reviewer can both resolve them. If you addressed a reviewer&#39;s comment, resolve the thread and leave a note: &quot;Fixed in commit a1b2c3d.&quot;</p>
<h3>Do not &quot;pile on&quot;</h3>
<p>If five people already said the same thing about an issue, you don&#39;t need to add a sixth comment saying the same thing. A 👍 reaction on an existing comment is enough.</p>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<p>GitHub reactions (👍 ❤️ 🎉 😕 👀 🚀) are an efficient way to express agreement, appreciation, or concern without adding noise to a thread.</p>
<h3>Saved Replies — Your Accessibility Win</h3>
<p>GitHub lets you save frequently used responses as <strong>Saved Replies</strong> — reusable text snippets you can insert into any comment box with a few keystrokes. This is a significant accessibility win for anyone who types the same comments repeatedly during triage, reviews, or issue management.</p>
<p><strong>Common uses:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Thank you for your contribution! I&#39;ll take a look this week.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;This looks like a duplicate of #N — closing, please continue the discussion there.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I&#39;ve labeled this <code>good first issue</code>. To claim it, leave a comment saying you&#39;d like to work on it and I&#39;ll assign you.&quot;</li>
<li>Your team&#39;s standard accessibility issue acknowledgement template</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Creating a Saved Reply:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to <code>github.com/settings/replies</code></li>
<li>Activate <strong>&quot;Add a saved reply&quot;</strong></li>
<li>Give it a title (e.g., &quot;Good first issue claim&quot;) — this is what you search for</li>
<li>Type the full reply text in the body (Markdown is supported)</li>
<li>Save</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Using a Saved Reply in a comment:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to any comment text area</li>
<li>Activate the <strong>Saved Replies button</strong> (the speech bubble icon in the comment toolbar, or press <code>Ctrl+.</code> if enabled)</li>
<li>A dropdown appears showing your saved replies — type to filter by title</li>
<li>Select the reply — it inserts into the text area</li>
<li>Edit as needed before submitting</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Screen reader path:</strong></p>
<pre><code>In a comment text area:
→ Tab to the toolbar icons
→ &quot;Saved replies&quot; button → Enter
→ Filter by typing part of the title
→ ↑/↓ to select → Enter to insert
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Limit:</strong> GitHub allows up to 100 saved replies per account.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Code Review Etiquette — For Reviewers</h2>
<h3>Review the code, not the person</h3>
<p>❌ &quot;You clearly don&#39;t understand accessibility.&quot;<br>✅ &quot;This implementation doesn&#39;t account for keyboard navigation — here&#39;s how to add it.&quot;</p>
<h3>Don&#39;t gatekeep knowledge</h3>
<p>If a contributor makes a mistake because they didn&#39;t know something, explain the concept. They&#39;re here to learn.</p>
<h3>Ask questions instead of making demands</h3>
<p>❌ &quot;Change this to use <code>aria-label</code>.&quot;<br>✅ &quot;What do you think about using <code>aria-label</code> here instead? Screen readers would then announce the button&#39;s purpose directly.&quot;</p>
<h3>Distinguish opinion from requirement</h3>
<p>If something is your stylistic preference but NOT a bug or correctness issue, say so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The current implementation is correct. I personally prefer the pattern in utils/helpers.js, but this is a nit — feel free to keep it as-is.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Approve explicitly</h3>
<p>When a PR is ready to merge, say so clearly — either by using the Approve review option, or in a comment: &quot;This looks great to me! No blockers on my end.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<h2>Code Review Etiquette — For Authors</h2>
<h3>Say thank you</h3>
<p>When someone takes time to review your work, acknowledge it — even if you disagree with some feedback.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Thanks so much for the thorough review! I&#39;ve addressed all but the last comment — see my note there.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Don&#39;t take feedback personally</h3>
<p>Code review is about the code, not your worth as a person or developer. Even the most senior contributors receive change requests.</p>
<h3>Explain your choices</h3>
<p>If you are keeping your implementation despite feedback, explain why.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I considered <code>aria-label</code> here, but I went with a visually-hidden <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> instead because it allows translators to localize the text more easily. Let me know if you think that tradeoff is wrong.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Surface blockers early</h3>
<p>Don&#39;t wait until you have finished a 500-line PR to mention that you weren&#39;t sure about the approach. Open a Draft PR early and ask.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Inclusive Commenting for Accessibility Issues</h2>
<p>When filing or discussing accessibility bugs, additional context helps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Describe what was announced</strong> — quote your screen reader&#39;s exact output when possible</li>
<li><strong>Do not assume all users experience the same thing</strong> — NVDA users, JAWS users, and VoiceOver users may have different experiences</li>
<li><strong>Be precise about versions</strong> — accessibility behavior changes between OS and screen reader versions</li>
<li><strong>Represent the gap</strong> — &quot;This means that [group of people] cannot [do the thing]&quot; — frame in impact, not just symptoms</li>
<li><strong>Don&#39;t catastrophize or be dismissive</strong> — &quot;No blind person can use this&quot; may be inaccurate; be precise about the specific failure and its scope</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>The &quot;Good First Issue&quot; Social Contract</h2>
<p>When a maintainer labels an issue <code>good first issue</code>, they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investing time</strong> — good first issues require extra documentation and mentorship</li>
<li><strong>Signaling welcome</strong> — they want to support a new contributor</li>
</ul>
<p>When you take a good first issue, your responsibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Comment to claim it</strong> — &quot;Hi, I&#39;d like to work on this. Can I be assigned?&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Wait for assignment</strong> — do not start until assigned; two people working in parallel wastes everyone&#39;s time</li>
<li><strong>Check in if stuck</strong> — &quot;I&#39;ve been working on this for a day and I&#39;m stuck on X — can you point me in the right direction?&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Check in if unavailable</strong> — &quot;Life got busy and I can&#39;t finish this by the original estimate — is it okay if I extend by a week, or should you reassign?&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Don&#39;t disappear</strong> — if you claim an issue, see it through or explicitly hand it back</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Handling Difficult Situations</h2>
<h3>When you receive harsh feedback</h3>
<ol>
<li>Take a breath before responding — there is no urgency; the thread will wait</li>
<li>Look for the valid concern underneath the harsh words</li>
<li>Respond to the concern, not the tone</li>
<li>If the behavior crosses into harassment, report it via the &quot;...&quot; button on the comment → &quot;Report&quot;</li>
</ol>
<h3>When you disagree with a decision</h3>
<ol>
<li>Make your case once, clearly and with evidence</li>
<li>Accept that the maintainer has the final say in their project</li>
<li>If you strongly disagree, you can fork the project and take it in a different direction — this is legitimate in open source</li>
</ol>
<h3>When someone is rude to you</h3>
<ol>
<li>You do not have to engage</li>
<li>You can reply once to state your boundary: &quot;I&#39;m happy to discuss the technical merits, but I&#39;d prefer if we kept the conversation constructive.&quot;</li>
<li>Report via GitHub&#39;s reporting tools if the behavior is abusive</li>
</ol>
<h3>When you accidentally caused offense</h3>
<ol>
<li>Acknowledge it directly: &quot;I can see how that came across as dismissive — that wasn&#39;t my intention.&quot;</li>
<li>Do not over-explain or defend excessively</li>
<li>Adjust going forward</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Community Health Files</h2>
<p>A healthy open source project makes these expectations explicit and visible. When you join a project, always check:</p>
<h3>CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</h3>
<p>Community standards and what behavior is expected. Most projects use the <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/">Contributor Covenant</a>. When you see this file, it means:</p>
<ul>
<li>The maintainers take community health seriously</li>
<li>There is a process for reporting violations</li>
<li>You are protected and expected to protect others</li>
</ul>
<h3>CONTRIBUTING.md</h3>
<p>Specific instructions for how to contribute to this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to set up the development environment</li>
<li>The branch and PR naming conventions</li>
<li>What tests to run before submitting</li>
<li>How to have a change considered</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Always read CONTRIBUTING.md before opening a PR.</strong> Skipping it leads to rejected PRs and wasted effort.</p>

<h3>🔥 Day 2 Amplifier — Agent Forge Outputs Are Your Responsibility</h3>
<p><strong>Every communication principle in this guide applies with extra force when agents are involved.</strong> When <code>@pr-review</code> generates review comments, <em>you</em> are responsible for their tone before you post them. When <code>@issue-tracker</code> drafts a triage reply, <em>your</em> name appears on it in the repository&#39;s public history. The agent writes — the contributor publishes.</p>
<p>As you work with agents on Day 2, use this guide as your editing checklist:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In VS Code</strong> — Review every agent-generated comment against the &quot;anatomy of helpful feedback&quot; section before posting; use the &quot;phrases that work&quot; table to refine anything that reads as automated, generic, or cold</li>
<li><strong>In your repo</strong> — Agent Forge outputs are first drafts, not final words; the community you contribute to experiences your judgment, not the agent&#39;s draft</li>
<li><strong>In the cloud</strong> — GitHub Agentic Workflow comments must be designed with the same care as human comments: clear purpose, respectful language, and a transparent signal that automation posted them</li>
</ul>
