    <h1>Chapter Progression Analysis</h1>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p><strong>✅ Current structure IS properly progressive.</strong> The 20 chapters (including new Learning Room guide) form a clear learning arc from absolute beginner (GitHub web) through intermediate (collaborative GitHub) to advanced (VS Code + AI/Agents). Chapter dependencies are logical. No reorganization needed.</p>
<p><strong>✅ New &quot;The Learning Room&quot; chapter (02a) fills a critical gap</strong> — students now understand the shared environment before learning individual skills.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Foundation Level: Understanding the Environment</h2>
<pre><code>00. Pre-Workshop Setup
    └─ Objective: System ready, screen reader configured
       Dependency: None (prerequisite step)

01. Understanding GitHub Web Structure
    └─ Objective: Mental model of how GitHub pages are organized
       Dependency: None
       Skills: Landmarks, headings, page layout, navigation strategy
       Leads to: 02 (scheduling) + 03a (environment context)

02. Day 1 Agenda
    └─ Objective: Know the schedule and activities
       Dependency: 01 (understand the tool first)
       Introduces: Two-track learning model
       Leads to: 03a (read about your learning environment)

✨ NEW 02a. The Learning Room
    └─ Objective: Understand shared repo, PR sharing, automation system
       Dependency: 02 (know what skills you&#39;re practicing)
       Skills: PR workflow, peer review, bot feedback types
       Leads to: 03 (now you know WHY we need to navigate repos)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Why This Order:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Students arrive with anxiety (&quot;Will I break something?&quot;)</li>
<li>Chapter 01 shows how GitHub is organized (reduce anxiety)</li>
<li>Chapter 02 shows the schedule (build confidence)</li>
<li>Chapter 02a explains the shared environment (now they&#39;re READY)</li>
<li>They&#39;re ready to learn individual skills (03-09)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Day 1: Skill Building (Progressive)</h2>
<pre><code>Skill Level 1: Basic Repo Navigation
03. Navigating Repositories ★★☆☆☆
    └─ Dependency: 02a (know you&#39;re in a shared repo with others)
       Skills: Finding files, reading commits, switching branches
       Prerequisite for: 04 (can&#39;t file issue until you navigate)

Skill Level 2: Issue Management
04. Working with Issues ★★☆☆☆
    └─ Dependency: 03 (must navigate to find the issue list)
       Skills: Filing, searching, filtering, commenting, @mentions
       Prerequisite for: 05 (issues and PRs are linked - &quot;Closes #X&quot;)

Skill Level 3: Pull Request Mechanics
05. Working with Pull Requests ★★★☆☆
    └─ Dependency: 04 (PRs reference issues with &quot;Closes #XX&quot;)
       Skills: Creating, reviewing, merging, commit history
       Prerequisite for: 06 (conflicts only happen in PRs)

Level 1 Problem-Solving: Merge Conflicts
06. Merge Conflicts ★★★★☆
    └─ Dependency: 05 (must understand PRs before fixing conflicts)
       Skills: Understanding conflict markers, resolving, communicating
       Prerequisite for: Nothing (reference when problem appears)
       Why NOT earlier: Students must try to merge before this makes sense

Soft Skills / Interaction
07. Culture and Etiquette ★★☆☆☆
    └─ Dependency: 05 (have written comments, now understand tone matters)
       Skills: Communication style, inclusive language, respect, asynchronous mindset
       Prerequisite for: 08 (labels/projects assume team coordination)
       Why after PRs: Students have actual experience now; advice lands better

Level 2: Organizing Work
08. Labels, Milestones, and Projects ★★★☆☆
    └─ Dependency: 07 (assumes shared team culture)
       Skills: Categorization, filtering, cross-reference, project boards
       Prerequisite for: 09 (notifications filtered by labels)
       Why here: Students see their own work is now categorized

Housekeeping/Optimization

<h2>Bridge: Day 1 → Day 2</h2>
<pre><code>10. Day 2 Agenda
    └─ Objective: Transition from browser to IDE
       Dependency: All of Day 1 (prerequisites established)
       Bridges: &quot;Here&#39;s why VS Code matters&quot; + &quot;Here&#39;s how it&#39;s accessible&quot;
       Leads to: 11 (introduces new tool: VS Code)
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>Day 2: Skill Amplification</h2>
<pre><code>Tool Foundation: IDE Setup
11. VS Code: Setup &amp; Accessibility Basics ★★☆☆☆
    └─ Dependency: 10 (understand why new tool)
       Skills: Screen reader mode, keyboard navigation, accessibility settings
       Prerequisite for: 12 (can&#39;t use git if VS Code is misconfigured)
       Why NOT on Day 1: New tool requires dedicated setup time

Core Tool: Version Control in IDE
12. VS Code: Git &amp; Source Control ★★★☆☆
    └─ Dependency: 11 (VS Code operational) + 03 (understand branches)
       Skills: Cloning, branching, staging, committing, merge handling
       Prerequisite for: 13 (PR extension uses git state)
       Amplifies: Chapter 05 (PRs) but FROM THE IDE instead of browser

IDE Integration: PR Extension
13. VS Code: GitHub PR Extension ★★★☆☆
    └─ Dependency: 12 (git status visible in extension)
       Skills: Viewing PRs, reviewing in IDE, checking out branches
       Prerequisite for: Nothing (can use browser instead)
       Amplifies: Chapter 05 (PRs) — same mechanics, IDE-local view
       Why here not earlier: Need IDE + git working first

AI Assistance: Copilot Inline
14. GitHub Copilot Basics ★★★★☆
    └─ Dependency: 11 (Copilot runs in VS Code)
       Skills: Accepting/rejecting suggestions, effective prompting
       Prerequisite for: 19 (agents build on Copilot understanding)
       Bridge concept: &quot;You understand the skill, now delegate parts to AI&quot;

Expert Culminating Skill: Code Review
15. Accessible Code Review ★★★★★
    └─ Dependency: 05 (PRs) + 12 (git) + 13 (PR extension) + 14 (Copilot context)
       Skills: Reviewing diffs with screen reader, leaving comments, semantic review, screen reader accessible reviewing
       Prerequisite for: 19 (agents automate what you master here)
       Why here: Culminating skill before showing automation; students need confidence before agentic workflows
       Pedagogical arc: Learn manual deep skill → show how to automate it

Reference/Advanced: Infrastructure &amp; Process
16. Issue Templates ★★★☆☆
    └─ Dependency: 04 (issue filing mechanics)
       Skills: YAML form creation, structured issues, automation triggers
       Prerequisite for: Nothing (optional automation)
       Category: Advanced - for facilitators or interested students

17. GitHub Actions &amp; Workflows ★★★★☆

       Skills: Custom agents, slash commands, async cloud workflows, code review automation
       Prerequisite for: Nothing (advanced optional amplification)
       Why last: Shows how to automate everything learned in 14-17; complete synthesis chapter
       Pedagogical arc: FINISH — &quot;Agent Forge does not replace what you learn. It amplifies it.&quot;
       Quote from README: This is the final synthesis showing automation of all manual skills

<h2>Dependency Chain: Critical Path</h2>
<p><strong>For a student to complete Block 5 (Real Contribution):</strong></p>
<pre><code>Must know:
  ✓ 00: System ready
  ✓ 01: GitHub structure (mental model)
  ✓ 02: What we&#39;re doing today (schedule)
  ✓ 02a: The shared learning room (our environment)
  ✓ 03: How to navigate repos (find the issue)
  ✓ 04: How to work with issues (read the assignment)
  ✓ 05: How to create and review PRs (THE MAIN SKILL)

Nice to know:
  ◇ 07: Culture/tone (makes comments better)
  ◇ 06: Conflicts (might not arise in first PR)
  ◇ 08-09: Labels/notifications (background context)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>For a student to complete Day 2:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Must complete:
  ✓ All of Day 1 (11 depends on 01-09)
  ✓ 10: Day 2 overview
  ✓ 11: VS Code setup
  ✓ 12: Git in VS Code
  
Then build:
  ◆ 13: PR extension (extends 05)
  ◆ 14: Copilot (new skill)
  ◆ 15: Code Review (culminating skill - master the manual deep skill)
  ◆ 16: Issue Templates (optional advanced)
  → 17: Agent Forge (automate what you&#39;ve mastered in 15)
  
Optional post-workshop:
  📚 Appendix G: GitHub Actions (infrastructure deep-dive)
  📚 Appendix H: GitHub Projects (boards, tables, roadmaps)
  📚 Appendix I: GitHub Discussions
  📚 Appendix J: GitHub Advanced Search
  📚 Appendix K: GitHub Releases and Tags
  📚 Appendix L: Repository Insights
  📚 Appendix N: GitHub Flavored Markdown (advanced GFM reference)
  📚 Appendix O: GitHub Security Features (Dependabot, scanning, advisories)
  📚 Appendix P: Branch Protection Rules and Repository Rulesets
  📚 Appendix Q: Resources (every link and reference)

<h2>Verification: Is This Truly Progressive?</h2>
<h3>Criterion 1: Foundation Before Complexity</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>✅ PASS</strong> — Chapters 00-02a establish context; chapters 03-05 teach basic mechanics</li>
<li><strong>✅ PASS</strong> — Chapters 06-09 assume all prior skills understood</li>
<li><strong>✅ PASS</strong> — Chapter 10 explicitly marks transition</li>
</ul>
<h3>Criterion 2: Prerequisites Met</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>✅ PASS</strong> — 04 (issues) comes after 03 (navigation); can&#39;t manage issues without finding them</li>
<li><strong>✅ PASS</strong> — 05 (PRs) comes after 04 (issues); PRs reference issues</li>
<li><strong>✅ PASS</strong> — 06 (conflicts) comes after 05 (PRs); conflicts only happen in PR merges</li>
<li><strong>✅ PASS</strong> — 12 (git) comes after 11 (setup); git requires VS Code operational</li>
<li><strong>✅ PASS</strong> — 13 (PR extension) comes after 12 (git state); extension depends on git</li>
<li><strong>✅ PASS</strong> — 14 (Copilot) comes after 11 (setup); Copilot runs in VS Code</li>
<li><strong>✅ PASS</strong> — 15 (Code Review) comes after 14 (Copilot context) + 05,12,13 (foundational skills)</li>
<li><strong>✅ PASS</strong> — 17 (Agent Forge) comes after 14 (Copilot) + 15 (mastery of code review); automates what students have learned</li>
<li><strong>✅ PASS</strong> — Appendix G (GitHub Actions) is heavy infrastructure, appropriately moved to optional post-workshop reference</li>
</ul>
<h3>Criterion 3: No Jumps or Leaps</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>✅ PASS</strong> — Adjacent chapters reinforce each other</li>
<li><strong>✅ PASS</strong> — Each chapter builds incrementally on prior knowledge</li>
<li><strong>✅ PASS</strong> — Cross-chapter references are backward (newer chapter references prior chapter), never forward</li>
</ul>
<h3>Criterion 4: Day 1 → Day 2 Bridge</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>✅ PASS</strong> — Chapter 10 explicitly marks the transition</li>
<li><strong>✅ PASS</strong> — Chapter 11 repeats Day 1 foundations in new tool (accessibility, keyboard nav, landmarks)</li>
<li><strong>✅ PASS</strong> — Chapters 12-15 show Day 1 skills (PR, git, review) amplified in VS Code</li>
</ul>
<h3>Criterion 5: Soft Skills Appropriately Placed</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>✅ PASS</strong> — Chapter 07 (culture) comes AFTER 03-06 (students have experience)</li>
<li><strong>✅ PASS</strong> — Chapter 08 (organization) comes AFTER 07 (assumes team coordination)</li>
<li><strong>✅ PASS</strong> — Chapter 14 (code review) comes BEFORE Chapter 16 (students learn manual skill first, then automation)</li>
<li><strong>✅ PASS</strong> — Chapter 16 (Agent Forge) is FINAL (student mastery of all prior skills gets automated and amplified)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Additional Improvements Made with New Chapter 02a</h2>
<h3>Problems Solved by New Chapter</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Removed ambiguity:</strong> Students didn&#39;t understand they were working in ONE shared repo, not personal forks</li>
<li><strong>Reduced anxiety:</strong> Explicit explanation that all PRs are visible, bot feedback is helpful, peer review is safe</li>
<li><strong>Clarified automation:</strong> Bot + human feedback explained, automation not mysterious</li>
<li><strong>Referenced early:</strong> Chapter 02 now points to 02a immediately, before skills chapters</li>
<li><strong>Integrated PR sharing:</strong> Day 1 agenda Block 5 now assumes students understand the Learning Room</li>
</ol>
<h3>Updated Documents</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="README.md">README.md</a> — Added 02a to chapter navigation</li>
<li><a href="docs/02-day1-agenda.md">docs/02-day1-agenda.md</a> — Added &quot;Read This BEFORE Day 1&quot; section pointing to 02a</li>
<li><a href="docs/03a-the-learning-room.md">docs/03a-the-learning-room.md</a> — New comprehensive guide</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Final Recommendation</h2>
<h3>✅ <strong>Move GitHub Actions to Appendix G — Lighter Path for Intro Course</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Why This Change Is Correct:</strong></p>
<p>GitHub Actions is infrastructure-heavy (YAML, triggers, CI/CD) and doesn&#39;t belong in an introductory workshop curriculum. Instead:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Core chapters end at 17:</strong> Agent Forge synthesis (final culminating chapter)</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Actions moves to Appendix G:</strong> Available as optional post-workshop reference for advanced practitioners</li>
<li><strong>Resources stays as Appendix Q:</strong> Final appendix with links and tools (17 appendices A–Q, no M)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Benefits of This Reordering:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lighter path for intro students</strong>: No heavy infrastructure learning before they ship their first code</li>
<li><strong>Agent Forge becomes the natural finale</strong>: Students master code review (Ch 15) → then see it automated (Ch 17)</li>
<li><strong>Smart optional learning</strong>: GitHub Actions available for students who want deeper automation knowledge post-workshop</li>
<li><strong>Clear boundaries</strong>: Main curriculum (00-17) vs. Advanced References (Appendices A–Q)</li>
<li><strong>Security coverage</strong>: New Appendix O covers Dependabot, secret scanning, code scanning, and private vulnerability reporting</li>
<li><strong>GFM authoring reference</strong>: New Appendix N covers alert blocks, Mermaid diagrams, math, and screen reader guidance</li>
<li><strong>Branch protection guide</strong>: New Appendix P helps contributors diagnose why PRs are blocked</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Foundation → intermediate → advanced progression remains logical</li>
<li>Main chapters maintain pedagogical clarity and accessibility</li>
<li>Day 1 and Day 2 progression is clean and focused</li>
<li>Appendices serve learners at their own pace post-workshop</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Files Updated:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>README.md</code> — Chapter count now 17 (vs 18); GitHub Actions moved to Appendix G</li>
<li><code>CHAPTER_PROGRESSION_ANALYSIS.md</code> — Complete dependency re-verification</li>
<li><code>docs/</code> — Files renamed to reflect new chapter/appendix structure</li>
</ul>
<h3>Suggested Optional Enhancements</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Add a &quot;Prerequisites&quot; section to each chapter</strong> — at the top, list which chapters should be read first</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code># 04. Working with Issues

**Prerequisites:** Chapters 03 (navigation), 02a (Learning Room)
**Recommended before:** Chapter 05 (pull requests)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Add forward references in chapters</strong> — hint at what&#39;s coming next</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>Next chapter: Chapter 05 (Pull Requests) — you&#39;ll create PRs to resolve your issues
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Add difficulty badges to the chapter list in README</strong></p>
