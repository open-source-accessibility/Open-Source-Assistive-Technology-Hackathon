    <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
<h2>Our Pledge</h2>
<p>We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.</p>
<p>We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Our Standards</h2>
<p>Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people</li>
<li>Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences</li>
<li>Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback</li>
<li>Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience</li>
<li>Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of unacceptable behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind</li>
<li>Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>
<li>Public or private harassment</li>
<li>Publishing others&#39; private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without their explicit permission</li>
<li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Accessibility Commitment</h2>
<p>This community has an explicit commitment to accessibility. All participants — contributors, facilitators, reviewers, and community members — are expected to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write documentation, issues, and pull requests in a way that screen reader users can navigate and understand</li>
<li>Use descriptive link text (not &quot;click here&quot; or bare URLs in prose)</li>
<li>Maintain proper heading hierarchy in all Markdown content</li>
<li>Provide alt text when adding images</li>
<li>Avoid posting images of text — write the text directly in the comment or document</li>
<li>Never dismiss accessibility-related issues or feedback as low priority or &quot;edge cases&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Accessibility concerns raised by community members are treated with the same urgency as any other bug report.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Enforcement Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>
<p>Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Enforcement</h2>
<p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement using the contact information below. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.</p>
<p>All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.</p>
<p><strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:jeff@jeffbishop.com">jeff@jeffbishop.com</a></p>
<p>Do not open a public GitHub issue to report Code of Conduct concerns — report them directly to the email address above so that the matter can be handled privately.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Enforcement Guidelines</h2>
<p>Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:</p>
<h3>1. Correction</h3>
<p><strong>Community Impact:</strong> Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.</p>

<p><strong>Consequence:</strong> A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.

<h3>3. Temporary Ban</h3>
<p><strong>Community Impact:</strong> A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Consequence:</strong> A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.
