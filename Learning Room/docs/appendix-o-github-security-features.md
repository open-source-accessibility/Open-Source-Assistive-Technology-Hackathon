# Appendix O: GitHub Security Features
## Dependabot, Secret Scanning, Code Scanning, and Private Advisories

> **Who this is for:** Anyone contributing to open source repositories needs to understand how GitHub protects code and what security alerts mean. This appendix explains the GitHub Security tab, how to interpret and respond to alerts, and how to responsibly report vulnerabilities — including in `accesswatch/agent-forge`.

## 1. The Security Tab — What It Contains

Every GitHub repository has a **Security tab** in its navigation bar. What you see there depends on whether you are a contributor with elevated access or a public viewer.

**Public viewers see:**
- Security policy (if the repo has a `SECURITY.md`)
- The private vulnerability reporting form (if enabled by the maintainer)

**Contributors with write or admin access see:**
- Dependabot alerts
- Secret scanning alerts
- Code scanning alerts
- Security advisories
- The ability to manage security settings

### Screen Reader Path to the Security Tab

```
On any repository page:
Tab navigation → secondary nav region → "Security" link → Enter
Or: G then S (GitHub keyboard shortcut — enable Focus Mode first)
```

## 2. Dependabot — Automated Dependency Updates

Dependabot is GitHub's automated dependency monitoring and update system. It does two things:

### Dependabot Alerts

When a known security vulnerability (CVE — Common Vulnerability and Exposure) is discovered in a package your project depends on, GitHub creates a **Dependabot alert**.

**Alert severity levels:**

| Level | CVSS Score Range | What it means |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Critical** | 9.0–10.0 | Exploit likely, wide impact — fix immediately |
| **High** | 7.0–8.9 | Significant risk — fix this sprint |
| **Medium** | 4.0–6.9 | Some risk with specific conditions — schedule fix |
| **Low** | 0.1–3.9 | Low likelihood of exploitation — fix when convenient |

**What a dependency alert looks like:**

```
Alert: Dependabot alert #5
Severity: High
Package: lodash (npm)
Vulnerable version: < 4.17.21
Fixed version: 4.17.21
Advisory: GHSA-35jh-r3h4-6jhm
Description: Prototype pollution vulnerability allows an attacker to
modify Object.prototype leading to denial of service or remote code execution.
```

**What to do as a contributor when you see an alert:**

1. Read the advisory to understand the vulnerability scope
2. Check whether the project actually uses the vulnerable code path
3. The fix is almost always: update the dependency to the fixed version
4. Dependabot Security Updates may have already opened a PR — check the PRs tab

### Dependabot Security Updates

If enabled, Dependabot automatically opens a PR to update the vulnerable dependency. The PR will look like:

```
Title: Bump lodash from 4.17.20 to 4.17.21
Author: dependabot[bot]
Description: Bumps lodash from 4.17.20 to 4.17.21.
  - Release notes
  - Changelog
  - Commits (linked)
```

As a contributor with access, reviewing and merging these Dependabot PRs is a high-value, low-risk way to contribute.

### Dependabot Version Updates

Beyond security fixes, Dependabot can be configured to open PRs keeping all dependencies at their latest versions (not just security fixes). This is configured in `.github/dependabot.yml`.

**Example `dependabot.yml`:**
```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
```

## 3. Secret Scanning — Preventing Credential Leaks

Secret scanning detects if you accidentally commit tokens, API keys, passwords, or other credentials to a repository.

### Push Protection (Real-Time Prevention)

**Push Protection** intercepts a `git push` before it reaches GitHub and blocks it if it detects a known secret pattern.

If your push is blocked:

```
remote: error: GH013: Repository rule violations found for refs/heads/main.
remote: Push cannot contain secrets
remote: 
remote: - commit: abc123 in file: config.js
remote:   secret: GitHub Personal Access Token
remote:   location: line 5
```

**What to do:**

1. Remove the secret from the file immediately
2. Rotate the exposed credential (GitHub will automatically revoke detected GitHub tokens)
3. If it was a false positive, you can bypass with justification — but investigate first

**Best practice:** Use environment variables for secrets, never hardcode them. Example:

```javascript
// BAD — never do this
const token = "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx";

// GOOD
const token = process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN;
```

### Secret Scanning Alerts

For public repositories, GitHub scans all existing commits and creates alerts for any detected secrets. These appear in Security → Secret scanning.

**Priority action:** If you find a secret scanning alert in a project you contribute to — especially a token or API key — treat it as urgent. The credential may have been exposed for a long time.

## 4. Code Scanning and CodeQL

Code scanning uses static analysis to find security vulnerabilities in the code itself (not dependencies). GitHub's built-in tool is **CodeQL**, which understands the code's logic and can detect:

- SQL injection risks
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
- Path traversal issues
- Insecure cryptography usage
- Authentication bypasses
- Command injection risks

### Reading a Code Scanning Alert

```
Alert: Uncontrolled format string
Rule: py/tainted-format-string
Severity: High
File: src/utils/logger.py
Line: 47

Details:
  logging.info(user_input)  ← user_input flows unsanitized into format string
  
  Flow:
  1. User input enters at: request.args.get('message') [line 12]
  2. Passed to: logger.info(message) [line 47]
  3. Risk: format string injection if message contains %s, %d patterns
```

**As a contributor:** Code scanning alerts are excellent, well-scoped contribution opportunities. Each alert shows you the exact file, line, and the data flow causing the issue. Fixing it is often a one-line change.

### Where to Find Code Scanning Alerts

Security tab → Code scanning → filter by severity, rule, or file.

## 5. Private Vulnerability Reporting

When you discover a security vulnerability in a project, **never report it as a public issue**. A public issue immediately broadcasts the vulnerability to anyone who could exploit it.

GitHub provides **Private Vulnerability Reporting** — a disclosure form that sends your report only to the repository's security team, not to the public.

### How to Submit a Private Report

1. Navigate to the repository's **Security tab**
2. Select **"Report a vulnerability"** (this button only appears if the maintainer has enabled private reporting)
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Title:** Short description of the vulnerability
   - **Description:** Detailed explanation, how to reproduce it, and impact
   - **Severity:** Your assessment
   - **Affected versions:** Which versions are vulnerable
   - **CVSS score:** Optional — the Common Vulnerability Scoring System rating
4. Submit — only the maintainers see your report

### The Responsible Disclosure Process

After you submit:
1. Maintainers acknowledge your report (typically within 1–7 days for active projects)
2. They may ask follow-up questions in the private advisory thread
3. They develop and test a fix
4. They request a CVE (Common Vulnerability and Exposure) number from GitHub
5. They publish a new release with the fix
6. They publish a public security advisory — you may be credited as the reporter
7. The CVE is published publicly (usually 90 days after report or after the fix is released)

### What If the Maintainer Doesn't Respond?

If a maintainer doesn't respond within a reasonable time (30–90 days is the standard window):
1. Send a follow-up in the private advisory thread
2. Contact GitHub directly if the issue is critical (GitHub can assist with coordinated disclosure)
3. Follow the project's SECURITY.md for their stated disclosure policy

---

## 6. The SECURITY.md File

A `SECURITY.md` file at the repository root defines the project's security policy. It typically contains:

- **Supported versions:** Which versions receive security patches
- **Reporting instructions:** How to report a vulnerability (email, private advisory form, etc.)
- **Response timeline:** How quickly maintainers aim to respond
- **Disclosure policy:** When the project will publish a fix publicly

**Agent-forge's security policy:** `accesswatch/agent-forge` has a `SECURITY.md` that points to GitHub's private advisory form. If you find a security issue in agent-forge — even a potential one — use the private advisory form rather than opening a public issue.

### Navigating to a Repository's SECURITY.md

From the repository:
1. Security tab → Policies section → "Security policy" link
2. Or directly: `https://github.com/owner/repo/security/policy`

Screen reader path:
```
Security tab → H → "Policy" heading → Link: "Security policy" → Enter
```

## 7. Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

An SBOM is a machine-readable inventory of every component (libraries, packages, dependencies) in a software project. It is increasingly required by enterprise and government organizations for supply chain security compliance.

### Exporting an SBOM from GitHub

1. Navigate to the repository's **Insights tab**
2. Select **"Dependency graph"**
3. Select **"Export SBOM"** button (top right of the Dependency graph page)
4. GitHub generates a SPDX-format JSON file listing all dependencies with their versions and licenses

This export is useful when:
- Your organization requires SBOM documentation before adopting an open source dependency
- You're auditing a project's complete dependency chain
- You want to identify license compatibility for a commercial product

## 9. Security and Agent Forge

Agent Forge's `/security-dashboard` slash command gives you a quick security overview without visiting the Security tab in the browser:

```
/security-dashboard
```

**Sample output:**

```
## Security Dashboard — accesswatch/agent-forge

### Dependabot Alerts
- 0 Critical
- 1 High: actions/cache < 3.3.2 (fixed: 3.3.3)
- 2 Medium: misc dependency updates available

### Secret Scanning
- No active alerts

### Code Scanning
- Last scan: 2 days ago — 0 new alerts

### Dependabot PRs Open
- #47: Bump actions/cache from 3.3.1 to 3.3.3
  "Review and merge to resolve the High severity alert"

### Recommendation
Action needed: Review PR #47 (5 minutes — single file change)
```

**Workshop exercise:** Run `/security-dashboard` on your fork after Day 2. Review any Dependabot PRs open on the upstream `accesswatch/agent-forge` — merging one is a real security contribution.
