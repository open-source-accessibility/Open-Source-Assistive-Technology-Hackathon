# Appendix K: GitHub Releases and Tags
## Understanding Versioned Releases and What They Mean for Contributors

> When a maintainer merges your PR, they may say "this will land in v2.1.0." This appendix explains what that means, how GitHub Releases work, how tags relate to releases, and how to navigate them with a screen reader.

## 1. What Is a Release?

A **release** is a named snapshot of a repository at a specific point in history, packaged and published for users.

For software projects, a release typically includes:
- A version number (e.g., `v2.1.0`)
- Release notes explaining what changed
- Links to download the compiled or packaged software (if applicable)
- Source code archives (automatically generated by GitHub)

For documentation-only or non-software projects, releases are often used to mark stable checkpoints or versions of a document.

**When your PR gets merged:** Your change becomes part of the code on the default branch. It will be *included* in the next release whenever the maintainer decides to publish one — this might be days, weeks, or months away depending on the project's release cadence.

---

## 2. Releases vs. Tags vs. Branches

These three concepts are closely related:

| Concept | What It Is | Lives |
|---|---|---|
| **Branch** | A movable pointer to the latest commit on a line of work | Permanently moves as commits are added |
| **Tag** | A fixed pointer to a single specific commit | Never moves — always points to the same commit |
| **Release** | A tag + release notes + optional downloadable assets published on GitHub | Based on a tag |

**The relationship:**
- Every release is backed by a tag
- A tag without a release is just a version marker in the git history
- GitHub automatically creates a tag when you create a release

## 3. Navigating Releases on GitHub

### Finding the Releases Page

From any repository page:
1. Look on the right sidebar for a **"Releases"** section showing the latest release
2. Activate "Releases" or the version link to go to the full releases page
3. Alternatively: navigate to `github.com/owner/repo/releases`

**Screen reader path:**
```
On the repository home page:
→ H or 3 to find "Releases" heading in the right sidebar
→ Tab to the latest release link → Enter
→ Or: Tab to "N Releases" count link → Enter → Opens full releases list
```

### The Releases List Page

Each release appears as a section with:
- The release title (usually the version number)
- A badge: "Latest" (most recent stable), "Pre-release", or nothing (older release)
- Publication date
- The tag name
- Release notes (the main body)
- Asset downloads (if included)
- Source code download links (always present — auto-generated zip/tar.gz)

**Navigation:**
```
2 → Jump between release title headings
K → Navigate links (download assets, compare, tag links)
↓ → Read release notes
```

## 4. Understanding Version Numbers

Most projects follow **Semantic Versioning** (semver): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

| Part | When It Changes | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `MAJOR` (e.g., `2.x.x`) | Breaking changes | Existing behavior changed in an incompatible way; users may need to update their code |
| `MINOR` (e.g., `x.1.x`) | New features, backward-compatible | New functionality added; existing code still works |
| `PATCH` (e.g., `x.x.1`) | Bug fixes | Something was broken and is now fixed |

**Examples:**
- `v2.0.0` → major release, breaking changes possible
- `v2.1.0` → new features added
- `v2.1.3` → three bug fixes since v2.1.0

**Pre-release suffixes** (not part of semver core, but common):
- `v2.1.0-alpha.1` → early preview, may be unstable
- `v2.1.0-beta.2` → feature-complete but still testing
- `v2.1.0-rc.1` → release candidate, nearly final

**Your contribution's journey:**
```
PR opened → PR reviewed → PR merged → default branch updated
                                              ↓
                                   Next release prepared
                                              ↓
                          Tag created → Release published → v2.1.1
```

## 5. Reading Release Notes

Release notes document what changed. High-quality release notes categorize changes:

```
## What's New in v2.1.0

### Breaking Changes
- The `preferences.md` format has changed — see the migration guide

### New Features
- Added `/project-status` command (#42, @alice)
- Added `/onboard-repo` command (#38, @bob)

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed keyboard navigation in the triage workflow (#51, @charlie)
- Screen reader announcement now correct for merged PRs (#48, @alice)

### Dependencies
- Updated github-mcp-server to v3.0.1

**Full Changelog:** https://github.com/owner/repo/compare/v2.0.0...v2.1.0
```

**The "Full Changelog" link** at the bottom of many release notes goes to a comparison view showing every merged PR between two tags. This is where you'll see your PR listed by name, with your username credited.

## 6. For Maintainers: Creating a Release

This section is relevant if you become a maintainer or contribute to a project that asks you to prepare releases.

### Creating a Release from the GitHub UI

1. Navigate to `github.com/owner/repo/releases/new`
2. **Choose a tag:** Type a new version tag (e.g., `v2.1.0`) — GitHub will create it on publish, or select an existing tag if you already created one
3. **Choose a target branch:** The branch the tag will be applied to (usually `main`)
4. **Release title:** Usually the same as the tag (e.g., `v2.1.0`)
5. **Release notes:** Write manually, or click **"Generate release notes"** — GitHub auto-generates from merged PR titles since the last release
6. **Assets:** Optionally attach compiled binaries or other files
7. **Pre-release toggle:** Mark as pre-release if it's alpha/beta
8. **Draft toggle:** Save as draft to prepare without publishing immediately
9. **Publish release**

### Using Agent Forge for Release Notes

The `/draft-release` command generates structured release notes automatically from your merged PRs — much faster and more consistent than writing them manually. See [Section 9](#9-agent-forge-draft-release).

---

## 7. Draft and Pre-Release States

**Draft release:** Saved but not published. Only visible to repository collaborators. Use drafts to prepare release notes in advance.

**Pre-release:** Published and visible, but not marked "Latest." Users who look for the latest stable version won't be directed to it automatically. Use for alpha/beta/RC versions.

**Latest release:** The most recent non-pre-release, non-draft release. This is what GitHub highlights in the sidebar and what `github.com/owner/repo/releases/latest` redirects to.

---

## 8. Screen Reader Navigation Reference

### Repository Home Page (finding releases)

```
Right sidebar:
→ H or 3 to find "Releases" heading
→ K to the version link (e.g., "v2.1.0") → Enter opens that release
→ K to the "N releases" count link → Enter opens full list
```

### Releases List Page

```
2         → Major section headings
3         → Individual release title headings (each release is an h2 or h3)
K         → Navigate links (assets, tag, compare)
↓         → Read release notes inline
```

### Individual Release Page

```
H / 2     → Section headings within release notes
I         → List items (change entries)
K         → Links (PRs referenced, comparison link, asset downloads)
```

### Comparing Two Releases (the Changelog)

The compare URL (`/compare/v1.0.0...v2.0.0`) shows a diff of all commits and merged PRs between two tags:

```
3         → Individual commit or PR headings
I         → Commit list items
```

---

## 9. Agent Forge: `/draft-release`

The `/draft-release` command automates release note generation from your merged pull requests.

**Usage:**
```
/draft-release v2.1.0
/draft-release owner/repo v2.1.0
```

**What it produces:**
- Auto-categorized changes: Breaking Changes, Features, Bug Fixes, Dependencies
- Each PR listed with number, title, and author
- A full changelog link
- Markdown formatted and ready to paste into GitHub's release editor

**Example output:**
```markdown
## v2.1.0

### New Features
- Add `/project-status` command (#42, @alice)
- Add `/onboard-repo` for first-time repo scanning (#38, @bob)

### Bug Fixes
- Fix keyboard navigation in triage workflow (#51, @charlie)
- Correct screen reader announcement for merged PRs (#48, @alice)

### Dependencies
- Update github-mcp-server to v3.0.1 (#55)

**Full Changelog:** https://github.com/accesswatch/agent-forge/compare/v2.0.0...v2.1.0
```

> **See also:** The `/release-prep` command runs a complete pre-release checklist (milestone status, open PRs, CI health, security, and then generates release notes) — useful when preparing a release from scratch rather than just generating notes.
