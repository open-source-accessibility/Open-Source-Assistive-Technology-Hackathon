## 1. Who This Is For

**Workshop participants:** You have already completed the contribution workflow during the workshop. This repository is an excellent first contribution target for applying what you practiced.

**Educators and facilitators:** You are welcome to fork the entire repository and adapt the materials for your own workshop program. Attribution is appreciated but not required (MIT license).

**Accessibility practitioners:** If you have domain expertise in a particular screen reader or assistive technology and notice something that is incorrect or incomplete, please open an issue or submit a correction. Your expertise is exactly what this documentation needs.

**People who find bugs:** A broken link, a command that has stopped working, an exercise that cannot be completed — all of these are legitimate bugs. Open an issue the same way you would for any software project.

---

## 2. What Kinds of Contributions Are Welcome

### Documentation Improvements

- **Corrections:** Wrong keyboard shortcut, screen reader command that has changed, broken external link, outdated UI description
- **Clarity:** A step that was confusing, an assumption that left someone behind, a paragraph that should be two
- **Gaps:** A common question that the documentation does not answer, an exercise step that was skipped
- **New content:** An additional exercise, a section about a tool or workflow not yet covered, a translation

### Issues and Bug Reports

- A command in the workshop exercises that does not work as described
- A screen reader behavior that differs from what the documentation says
- A broken link or missing image
- An exercise that assumes knowledge introduced later in the workshop

### Workshop Materials

- New exercises that reinforce a concept
- Facilitator notes based on running a session
- Timing adjustments based on real session experience
- Alternative approaches for participants on different operating systems

### What We Are Not Looking For Right Now

- Rewriting the complete voice or structure of the workshop — if you have large-scale ideas, open a discussion first
- Adding content about tools or platforms not currently mentioned in the workshop
- Automated link-checking or content generation without human review

## 3. Before You Start — Fork and Clone

You learned this workflow during the workshop. Here it is again as a reference.

### Fork the Repository

1. Navigate to the workshop repository on GitHub
2. Activate the **Fork** button (top right of the repository page)
3. Select your account as the fork destination
4. Wait for the fork to complete — you will be redirected to your copy

**Screen reader users:**
- NVDA / JAWS: Navigate by button (`B`) to find "Fork"
- VoiceOver: `VO+Right Arrow` to find "Fork" button, `VO+Space` to activate

### Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[workshop-repo-name].git
cd [workshop-repo-name]
```

### Add the Upstream Remote

This keeps your fork synchronized with the original repository:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/[original-owner]/[workshop-repo-name].git
```

Verify both remotes are configured:

```bash
git remote -v
```

Expected output:
```
origin    https://github.com/[your-username]/[workshop-repo-name].git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/[your-username]/[workshop-repo-name].git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/[original-owner]/[workshop-repo-name].git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/[original-owner]/[workshop-repo-name].git (push)
```

## 4. Contribution Workflow — Step by Step

This is the same workflow you practiced during the workshop, applied to a real contribution.

### Step 1 — Sync with Upstream

Always start from a current copy of the main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

### Step 2 — Create a Focused Branch

One issue or topic per branch. Branch names should describe the change:

```bash
git checkout -b fix-nvda-shortcut-section-05
git checkout -b add-exercise-03-alternative-macos
git checkout -b update-broken-links-resources
```

### Step 3 — Make Your Changes

Edit the file or files. Limit your changes to what is described in your branch name. Unrelated improvements belong in separate branches and separate pull requests.

**In VS Code:**
1. Open the file in the Explorer (`Ctrl+Shift+E`)
2. Make your edits
3. Save (`Ctrl+S`)

**In the GitHub web editor:**
1. Navigate to the file
2. Activate the pencil icon (Edit this file)
3. Make your changes
4. Use "Commit changes" to save directly to your branch

### Step 4 — Commit Your Changes

Write a commit message that a future contributor can read and understand without context:

```bash
git add docs/04-working-with-issues.md
git commit -m "fix: correct NVDA virtual cursor toggle shortcut in Section 3

The documented shortcut was NVDA+Space which is correct for switching
between browse and focus mode, but the exercise called it 'reading mode'
which is not a term NVDA uses. Updated to match NVDA's own terminology."
```

**Commit message format:**
```
type: short summary (under 72 characters)

Optional longer explanation of why the change was made, not just what
changed. What problem does this solve? What was wrong before?
```

Types: `fix`, `docs`, `exercise`, `style`, `chore`

### Step 5 — Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin fix-nvda-shortcut-section-05
```

### Step 6 — Open a Pull Request

1. Navigate to your fork on GitHub
2. A banner should appear: "Compare & pull request" — activate it
3. If no banner appears: Activate the **Pull requests** tab → **New pull request** → change the compare branch to your branch
4. Fill in the PR template (see below)
5. Submit

## 5. Writing and Style Guidelines

### Voice

- **Imperative mood for instructions:** "Navigate to the Issues tab" not "You should navigate to the Issues tab"
- **Present tense:** "The button opens a dialog" not "The button will open a dialog"
- **Specific:** Name the exact shortcut, exact menu item, exact element to look for — do not say "click the appropriate option"
- **Screen reader aware:** Include landmark context, not just visual position ("the Save button in the dialog footer" not "the blue button on the right")

### Structure

- Use heading levels consistently — H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections, H4 sparingly
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps — the order matters and participants need to count steps
- Use bulleted lists for options, items where order is unimportant
- Use code blocks (` ``` `) for all commands, keyboard shortcuts in context, and file paths
- Inline code (` `` `) for short references to a key name, command name, or file name

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Format all keyboard shortcuts in a table when listing more than two:

| Action | NVDA | JAWS | VoiceOver |
|--------|------|------|-----------|
| Focus search | `/` | `/` | `/` |

When mentioning a single shortcut inline: use backticks — `NVDA+F7`

### Links

- Link text should describe the destination — not "click here" or "this guide"
- Good: `[NVDA User Guide](https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/userGuide.html)`
- Bad: `[click here](https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/userGuide.html)`

## 6. Accessibility Requirements

Every document in this repository is used by screen reader users. Accessibility is not a nice-to-have — it is the primary requirement. All contributions must meet the following:

### Heading Structure

- Every heading must be in-sequence (no skipping from H2 to H4)
- Every document must have exactly one H1 (`#`) — the page title
- Headings must accurately describe the content they introduce

### Links and References

- No bare URLs in running text — always use descriptive link text
- Exception: the Resources document may list URLs in table columns labeled "URL" for copy-paste use

### Images and Media

- Every image requires meaningful alt text
- Alt text describes what the image shows, not just its label
- Decorative-only images (rare in documentation) may use empty alt `alt=""`
- This workshop avoids screenshots of UI because screen reader users cannot use them — prefer text descriptions and keyboard instructions

### Tables

- Every table must have a header row using `|---|` separator syntax in Markdown
- Table headers must be meaningful and concise
- Avoid merged cells — Markdown tables do not support them, and they create complex reading order for screen readers

### Code Blocks

- All terminal commands use fenced code blocks with language specified (` ```bash `)
- Inline code for short references uses single backticks
- Commands that produce output should show the expected output separately, labeled

## 7. HTML Documentation Build System

This repository automatically generates HTML versions of all markdown files. This ensures documentation is available in multiple formats for different access needs and distribution scenarios.

### How It Works

**Automatic conversion:**
- When you edit any `.md` file and push to the main branch, a GitHub Actions workflow automatically converts all markdown files to HTML
- Generated HTML files are committed back to the `html/` directory
- No manual intervention needed — the system handles it automatically

**What gets converted:**
- All markdown files in `docs/`
- All markdown files in `learning-room/`
- Root level markdown files (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.)

### Local Development

You can build HTML files locally to preview your changes before pushing:

```bash
# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Generate HTML files once
npm run build:html

# Watch mode — rebuilds HTML automatically when you save markdown files
npm run watch:html

# Clean generated HTML
npm run clean
```

Generated HTML files will be in the `html/` directory with the same folder structure as the source markdown files.

### HTML Features

The generated documentation includes:
- **GitHub-flavored styling** — familiar appearance for GitHub users
- **Syntax highlighting** for code blocks
- **Responsive design** — works on mobile and desktop
- **Accessible markup** — proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation
- **Breadcrumb navigation** — easy to return to home
- **High contrast mode support** — respects user preferences

### What You Need to Know When Contributing

**Committing markdown only:**
When you make a pull request, you only need to edit and commit the `.md` files. The HTML files will be automatically regenerated when your PR is merged to main.

**Testing the HTML locally (optional):**
If you want to verify how your markdown will look in HTML:
1. Run `npm install` (first time only)
2. Run `npm run build:html`
3. Open files in `html/` directory in your browser
4. Do NOT commit the HTML files in your PR — they will be auto-generated

**HTML files in the repository:**
The `html/` directory is committed to the repository so that:
- Documentation can be browsed directly from the repository
- HTML files are version-controlled alongside their markdown source
- GitHub Pages can serve the documentation without a build step

### Troubleshooting

**"npm: command not found"**
You need to install Node.js first. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended).

**Build errors:**
- Ensure all markdown files have valid syntax
- Check that code blocks use proper fence syntax (` ``` `)
- Look for unclosed brackets or parentheses in links

**HTML not updating:**
- Check the Actions tab on GitHub to see if the workflow ran
- Look for the commit message "Auto-generate HTML documentation from markdown"
- Verify the workflow has permissions to push to the repository

## 9. Screen Reader Guidance for Commands in This Document

If you are reviewing this repository using a screen reader, here are the relevant reading patterns.

### NVDA

- **Table navigation:** `T` to reach the table, then `Ctrl+Alt+Arrow Keys` to navigate cells
- **Code blocks** are read as preformatted text. NVDA reads the content character-by-character if you need to copy a command — use `NVDA+F8` to switch to flat review, then `NVDA+C` to copy a line
- **Headings:** `H` to jump between headings when in browse mode

### JAWS

- **Table navigation:** `T` to reach the table, `Ctrl+Alt+Arrow Keys` for cells
- **Code blocks:** `Insert+F5` (forms list) will not find code elements — navigate with cursor keys
- **Headings:** `H` forward, `Shift+H` backward

### VoiceOver (macOS)

- **Table navigation:** `VO+Right Arrow` through rows, `VO+Cmd+Right Arrow` through columns
- **Code blocks** in Markdown renderers on GitHub: navigate with `VO+Right Arrow`; activate "Select All" (`Cmd+A`) then "Copy" (`Cmd+C`) to copy a block
- **Heading navigation with Rotor:** `VO+U`, then left-right to select "Headings", then up-down to navigate

## 9. Submitting Your Pull Request

### PR Template

When you open a pull request, fill in the template that appears. If no template appears, include:

```markdown
## What does this change?

<!-- One or two sentences describing the change -->

## Why?

<!-- What problem does this fix or what gap does it address? -->

## How to test / review

<!-- What should a reviewer look at? Where is the change? -->

## Checklist

- [ ] Heading levels are in sequence (no skips)
- [ ] All links use descriptive text (no bare URLs in running text)
- [ ] Command examples are in fenced code blocks
- [ ] Tables have header rows
- [ ] Spelling and grammar reviewed
```

### PR Title Format

```
fix: correct JAWS shortcut for PR review in Section 3
docs: add alternative macOS exercise for Section 6
exercise: add bonus challenge for notifications day 2
```

### Size Guideline

Small, focused pull requests are reviewed faster and merged sooner. If you have multiple unrelated improvements, submit them as separate pull requests.
