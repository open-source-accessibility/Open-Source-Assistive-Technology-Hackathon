# GitHub Learning Curriculum
## Executive Summary & Proposal to GitHub

---

## Project Overview

**Title:** Comprehensive, Accessible GitHub Workshop Curriculum with AI Agent Integration  
**Scope:** 17-chapter structured learning path + interactive AI agents + accessibility-first design  
**Audience:** Developers, open-source contributors, maintainers, and facilitators  
**Status:** Complete curriculum ready for deployment  
**Note:** 2 additional agenda files (Day 1 & Day 2) provided for workshop facilitators (not part of learner sequence)  

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Gap
GitHub is powerful but intimidating for newcomers. Standard onboarding approaches:
- Assume prior Git/collaboration knowledge
- Don't explicitly teach soft skills (communication, inclusive review)
- Often lack accessibility guidance
- Don't leverage AI to amplify human expertise

Many organizations need structured, repeatable, accessible training that:
1. Teaches Git and GitHub concepts sequentially
2. Emphasizes inclusive collaboration practices
3. Includes accessibility requirements from day one
4. Integrates modern AI tools (GitHub Copilot agents)
5. Provides hands-on, guided practice with clear success criteria

### Impact
- **New developers** struggle with PR review culture and GitHub workflows
- **Maintainers** lack templates and automation to scale contributions
- **Accessibility advocates** have no GitHub-specific guidance
- **Facilitators** must recreate training materials from scratch

---

|---------|----------|-------|-------------|
| 14 | 1 hr + 3 exercises | Accessible code review | Keyboard-only, screen readers, diff navigation (NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver) |
| 15 | 1.5 hrs + 4 exercises | Issue templates | YAML, form fields, WCAG compliance, template design |
| 16 | 1.5 hrs + 3 exercises | Agent Forge | 6 AI agents, 28 slash commands, Template Builder wizard |

**AI Agent Integration:**
- **6 Agents:** Automate issue triage, PR review, analytics, accessibility tracking, daily briefings, template building
- **28 Slash Commands:** Targeted invocations for specific workflows
- **Template Builder (Agent 6 - NEW!):** Interactive wizard for guided template creation

**Outcome:** Teams can design accessible workflows and automate GitHub processes with confidence.

---

## Curriculum Highlights

### 1. Accessibility-First Design
- **Screen reader integration:** Every exercise tested with NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver
- **Keyboard-only workflows:** Users never require a mouse
- **Plain language:** Glossary for all terminology
- **Appendix B:** Screen Reader Cheatsheet (NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver commands)

**Why:** ~15% of population has disabilities; GitHub should be usable by all.

### 2. Hands-On Exercises
- **10+ guided exercises** across Chapters 4-5, 10-16 (all hands-on chapters)
- **Step-by-step walkthroughs:** 300-900 lines per exercise
- **"What you should see":" Checkpoint validation at each step
- **Troubleshooting:** "If not, try this" guidance embedded in every exercise

**Note on Chapters 10-13:** These VS Code chapters teach through integrated practice rather than standalone exercises - users configure tools, explore features, and practice workflows as they learn. Formal numbered exercises resume at Chapter 14.

**Example:** Exercise A (Ch 15) walks users through:
1. Navigating to template selector
2. Reading template instructions
3. Filling form fields accessibly
4. Previewing submission
5. Submitting issue
6. Verifying success
7. Reflecting on accessibility

**Why:** Users gain confidence; zero ambiguity on success criteria.

#### All 10 Exercises at a Glance

Comprehensive breakdown of every hands-on exercise across the curriculum:

- **Exercise 2: Extend Agent Capabilities** (6 steps) — Edit agent, add security workflow variant
- **Exercise 3: Iterative Refinement with Agent** (4 steps) — Generate → Modify → Refine → Observe pattern

**Exercise Structure (All 10+):**
- 300-900 lines per exercise
- "What you should see" checkpoints after each step
- "If this happens, try..." troubleshooting sections
- Screen reader commands embedded (NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver specific)

**Estimated Times:**
- Basic exercises (Ch 4-5): 30-45 min each
- Accessibility exercises (Ch 14): 1 hour each
- Template exercises (Ch 15): 1-1.5 hours each
- Agent exercises (Ch 16): 30-60 min each

### 3. AI Agent Integration
**The Template Builder Agent (NEW!)** exemplifies the curriculum's approach:

```yaml
Name: @template-builder
Feature: Interactive Ask Questions wizard
Use Case: Guided template creation for non-technical users
Workflow:
  1. Ask user project type (Web app? Library? Documentation?)
  2. Ask which fields are essential (5-field or 10-field template?)
  3. Ask about accessibility needs (WCAG AA compliance? Screen reader tested?)
  4. Generate YAML template with tested structure
  5. User copy-pastes into GitHub repository
Result: 5-minute template creation vs. 30 minutes manual YAML editing
```

**Why:** Amplifies user skill; automates the repetitive parts.

### 4. Supporting Documentation
- **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** (1-page cheat sheet for commands, shortcuts, file locations)
- **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** (20+ common problems with solutions)
- **appendix-u-resources.md** (links to WCAG, screen readers, documentation)
- **FAQ.md** (50+ questions organized by role and topic)
- **PROGRESS_TRACKER.md** (printable checklist for learners)
- **ACCESSIBILITY_TESTING.md** (checklist for testing templates & workflows)

**Why:** Users have context-specific help at their fingertips; facilitators have reference guides.

---

## Pedagogical Approach

### Three Core Principles

#### 1. Skill First, Agent Second
Agents amplify human expertise; they don't replace learning.

**Example:**
- Day 1: Learn to review PRs manually (read diffs, leave comments)
- Day 2: Use `@pr-review` agent to speed up that process

Result: Users understand when agent output is correct or needs editing.

#### 2. Manual → Automated → Mastered
Every exercise follows progression:

```
Manual Skill (User does 100% by hand)
    ↓
With Agent (User does 50%, agent does 50%)
    ↓
Mastered (User reviews agent work, makes final call)
```

**Example (Ch 15 Progress):**
1. **Exercise A:** Design template manually (GitHub web UI)
2. **Exercise B:** Clone, edit, test template locally (Git workflow)
3. **Exercise D:** Critique team's template (human judgment)
4. **Ch 16 - Exercise 1:** Use `@template-builder` to generate template in 5 min
5. **Ch 16 - Exercise 2:** Extend agent with new template variant
6. **Ch 16 - Exercise 3:** Guide agent iteratively (You: iterate; Agent: generates)

#### 3. Accessible by Default, Not Afterthought
Accessibility is woven into every chapter.

- Every issue template includes WCAG label suggestions
- Every code review teaches keyboard-only navigation
- Every agent prompt mentions "confirm with accessibility advocate"
- Every exercise includes screen reader instructions

**Why:** Builds inclusive habits from day one; not a retrofit.
