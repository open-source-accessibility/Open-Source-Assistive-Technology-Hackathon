  - "screen-reader-optimized" — heading-heavy structure, no tables, explicit empty-state messages

## Notification Priority

<!-- What should @daily-briefing surface first? -->
Accessibility issues first, then review requests assigned to me, then CI failures, then general activity.

## Review Comment Tone

<!-- How should @pr-review frame suggested comments? -->
Direct but constructive. Always explain the "why" behind a suggestion. Assume good intent from authors.

## Time Zone

<!-- Used by @daily-briefing to interpret "today", "yesterday", "last week" -->
America/New_York

## Accessibility Context

<!-- 
Tell agents about your own setup so they can tailor output.
Example: "I use NVDA with Chrome on Windows 11."
-->
I use [your screen reader] on [your OS].
