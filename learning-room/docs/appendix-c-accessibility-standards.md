# Appendix C: Accessibility Standards Reference
## WCAG, ARIA, and What They Mean for Your Contributions

> This appendix gives you a working understanding of the accessibility standards that govern the web, GitHub's interface, and the projects you will contribute to. You do not need to memorize these — use this as a lookup when a PR review mentions a specific standard or success criterion.

## 1. WCAG 2.2 — The Four Principles

WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) is organized around four principles, often abbreviated **POUR**:

| Principle | Meaning | Example Failure |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Perceivable** | Information must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive | An image with no alt text — a screen reader user gets nothing |
| **Operable** | UI components and navigation must be operable | A button that only works on hover — keyboard users cannot activate it |
| **Understandable** | Information and operation must be understandable | An error message that says "Invalid input" with no explanation of what is wrong |
| **Robust** | Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by assistive technologies | Custom JavaScript widgets with no ARIA roles — screen readers cannot determine what they are |

Every WCAG success criterion belongs to one of these four principles.

## 2. Conformance Levels: A, AA, AAA

| Level | Requirement | Who targets this |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **A** | Minimum accessibility — the baseline that removes the most severe barriers | Required by most accessibility laws |
| **AA** | Enhanced accessibility — removes significant barriers | Required by WCAG 2.2 compliance targets, most government and enterprise standards, GitHub's own accessibility commitment |
| **AAA** | Highest level — removes remaining barriers for the most niche cases | Not universally required; applied where feasible |

Most open source projects, and GitHub itself, target **WCAG 2.2 AA** compliance. When you file an accessibility bug or review a PR, AA is the standard to reference.

## 3. Key Success Criteria for Web Contributions

These are the criteria you will most commonly encounter when contributing to web projects or reviewing GitHub interface changes.

### Perceivable

| Criterion | Level | What It Requires |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| **1.1.1 Non-text Content** | A | All images, icons, and non-text content have a text alternative (`alt` attribute, `aria-label`, etc.) |
| **1.3.1 Info and Relationships** | A | Structure conveyed visually (headings, lists, tables) is also conveyed programmatically |
| **1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence** | A | Reading order makes sense when CSS is removed |
| **1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics** | A | Instructions do not rely solely on shape, color, or position ("click the green button" fails this) |
| **1.4.1 Use of Color** | A | Color is not the only means of conveying information |
| **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)** | AA | Text has at least 4.5:1 contrast ratio against its background (3:1 for large text) |
| **1.4.4 Resize Text** | AA | Text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or function |
| **1.4.10 Reflow** | AA | Content reflows at 400% zoom without horizontal scrolling |
| **1.4.11 Non-text Contrast** | AA | UI components and graphical objects have at least 3:1 contrast |

### Operable

| Criterion | Level | What It Requires |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| **2.1.1 Keyboard** | A | All functionality is available via keyboard |
| **2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap** | A | Keyboard focus can always be moved away from any component |
| **2.4.1 Bypass Blocks** | A | A mechanism to skip repeated navigation (skip link) |
| **2.4.2 Page Titled** | A | Pages have descriptive titles |
| **2.4.3 Focus Order** | A | Focus follows a logical sequence |
| **2.4.4 Link Purpose** | A | Link text describes the destination ("Read more about issues" not just "Read more") |
| **2.4.6 Headings and Labels** | AA | Headings and labels describe their topic or purpose |
| **2.4.7 Focus Visible** | AA | Keyboard focus indicator is visible |
| **2.4.11 Focus Appearance** | AA *(2.2 new)* | Focus indicator meets minimum size and contrast |
| **2.5.3 Label in Name** | A | For controls with visible labels, the accessible name contains the visible text |

### Understandable

| Criterion | Level | What It Requires |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| **3.1.1 Language of Page** | A | The default language is identified in the HTML (`lang` attribute) |
| **3.2.1 On Focus** | A | Receiving focus does not trigger unexpected context changes |
| **3.2.2 On Input** | A | Changing a setting does not cause unexpected changes unless the user is warned |
| **3.3.1 Error Identification** | A | Input errors are identified and described in text |
| **3.3.2 Labels or Instructions** | A | Labels or instructions are provided when user input is required |
| **3.3.3 Error Suggestion** | AA | When an error is detected, suggestions for correction are provided |

### Robust

| Criterion | Level | What It Requires |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| **4.1.1 Parsing** | A | HTML/markup does not have errors that break AT interpretation |
| **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value** | A | All UI components have accessible names, roles, and states that can be programmatically determined |
| **4.1.3 Status Messages** | AA | Status messages (e.g. "item added to cart") are announced without receiving focus |

## 4. ARIA — Roles, States, and Properties

WAI-ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) fills the gap between what HTML natively expresses and what complex interactive widgets require.

**Three categories:**

| Category | Purpose | Examples |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Roles** | What the element *is* | `role="button"`, `role="dialog"`, `role="tab"` |
| **States** | Current condition (can change) | `aria-expanded="false"`, `aria-checked="true"`, `aria-disabled="true"` |
| **Properties** | Stable characteristics | `aria-label="Close dialog"`, `aria-required="true"`, `aria-describedby="hint-text"` |

**Important rules:**

1. **Don't use ARIA if native HTML suffices.** A `<button>` is already a button — adding `role="button"` to a `<div>` is only needed when HTML semantics cannot be used.
2. **All interactive ARIA widgets must be keyboard operable.** Adding `role="button"` means you must also handle `Enter` and `Space` keypresses in JavaScript.
3. **ARIA only affects the accessibility tree.** It does not add visual styling or behavior — it only changes what assistive technologies announce.

## 5. ARIA Landmark Roles

Landmarks let screen reader users jump directly to major sections of a page. GitHub uses these extensively; screen reader users navigate between them with `D` (NVDA/JAWS) or the Rotor (VoiceOver).

| Role | HTML Equivalent | Purpose |
|------|----------------|---------|
| `banner` | `<header>` | Site-wide header |
| `navigation` | `<nav>` | Navigation links |
| `main` | `<main>` | Primary page content |
| `complementary` | `<aside>` | Supporting content |
| `contentinfo` | `<footer>` | Footer with copyright, links |
| `search` | `<search>` | Search functionality |
| `form` | `<form>` (with accessible name) | A significant form region |
| `region` | `<section>` (with accessible name) | A generic landmark with a label |

When multiple landmarks of the same type appear on a page, each should have a unique `aria-label` so screen readers can distinguish them. GitHub's Issues list page, for example, has multiple `navigation` regions each with distinct labels.

---

## 6. Common ARIA Patterns

### Accessible Button (when `<button>` cannot be used)

```html
<div role="button" tabindex="0" aria-pressed="false" onclick="toggle()" onkeydown="handleKey(event)">
  Toggle
</div>
```

### Accessible Form Field with Error

```html
<label for="username">Username</label>
<input id="username" type="text" aria-describedby="username-error" aria-invalid="true">
<span id="username-error" role="alert">Username cannot be empty</span>
```

### Live Region (status announcements)

```html
<div aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true">
  <!-- Content inserted here is announced automatically -->
  3 results found
</div>
```

Use `aria-live="assertive"` only for urgent interruptions (errors). Use `"polite"` for non-urgent status updates.

### Expandable Section

```html
<button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="details-panel">
  Show details
</button>
<div id="details-panel" hidden>
  ...content...
</div>
```

When expanded: set `aria-expanded="true"` and remove the `hidden` attribute.

## 7. How Standards Apply to GitHub Contributions

When you contribute to an open source project on GitHub, you will encounter accessibility in several contexts:

### Filing an Accessibility Bug

Reference the specific WCAG criterion. This makes the bug actionable:

> **Bad:** "The button isn't accessible."  
> **Good:** "The 'Subscribe' button has no visible focus indicator, failing WCAG 2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA). When navigating by keyboard, there is no visual indication of where focus is."

### Reviewing a PR for Accessibility

Checklist for any PR that touches HTML or UI:

- Do new images have `alt` attributes?
- Do new interactive elements work with keyboard only?
- Do new form fields have associated `<label>` elements?
- Are any new color-only indicators present?
- Does new dynamic content use `aria-live` if it updates without a page load?

### Writing Accessible Documentation

Documentation in Markdown is converted to HTML. Accessible Markdown:

- Use heading levels in order (don't skip from H1 to H3)
- Write descriptive link text (not "click here")
- Add alt text to images: `![Bar chart showing 40% improvement in task completion](chart.png)`
- Use actual lists (`-` or `1.`) rather than faking them with symbols

## 8. Testing Against Standards

### Automated Tools (catch ~30–40% of issues)

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| [axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/axe/) | Browser extension — run on any page, get WCAG violations with criterion references |
| [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) | Browser extension or web service — visual overlay showing issues |
| [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/) | Built into Chrome DevTools — accessibility audit with scores |
| [IBM Equal Access Checker](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/tools/) | Enterprise-grade browser extension |

### Manual Testing (catches the rest)

1. **Keyboard-only navigation** — unplug your mouse; can you do everything?
2. **Screen reader walkthrough** — navigate the feature with NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver
3. **200% zoom** — does content reflow without horizontal scrolling?
4. **High contrast mode** — Windows High Contrast or macOS Increase Contrast; are all elements still visible?
5. **Disable CSS** — does the content still make sense in reading order?
