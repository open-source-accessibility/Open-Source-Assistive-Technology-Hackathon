# Appendix I: GitHub Projects Deep Dive
## Boards, Tables, Roadmaps, Automations, and Accessible Navigation

> GitHub Projects is GitHub's built-in project management system. It connects issues and pull requests from one or more repositories into a living, filterable view that your whole team can see and act on. This appendix covers everything beyond the basics introduced in [Chapter 08: Labels, Milestones, and Projects](08-labels-milestones-projects.md).

## 1. Projects v2: What Changed

GitHub has two generations of project tooling. The current generation — called **Projects (v2)** — is what you'll find on any repository or organization page today.

| Feature | Classic Projects (v1) | Projects v2 (current) |
|---|---|---|
| Layouts | Kanban board only | Board, Table, Roadmap |
| Custom fields | None | Text, Number, Date, Select, Iteration |
| Automations | None built-in | Native GitHub Actions integration |
| Cross-repo | No | Yes |
| Filtering | Limited | Full field/label/assignee/status queries |
| API | Limited | Full GraphQL support |

If you see "Projects (Beta)" references in older documentation, those referred to the early rollout of v2. It is now stable and the default.

---

## 2. Creating a Project

Projects can be created at the **organization level** (shared across all repos in an org) or at the **repository level** (scoped to one repo).

### Create from an Organization

1. Navigate to your organization page (`github.com/your-org`)
2. Select the **Projects** tab
3. Activate **"New project"** button
4. Choose a template (blank table, blank board, feature release, etc.) or start empty
5. Give the project a name and select **"Create project"**

### Create from a Repository

1. Navigate to any repository
2. Select the **Projects** tab
3. Activate **"Link a project"** or **"New project"**
4. Follow the same template/name flow

### Screen Reader: Project Creation

```
1. Navigate to org or repo Projects tab
   → Tab to the green "New project" button → Enter
2. Template modal opens
   → Arrow keys to browse template cards
   → Enter to select a template
3. Name field: type your project name
4. "Create project" button: Tab → Enter
5. You land on the new empty project
```

---

## 3. The Three Layouts in Depth

### Table View

The default layout. A spreadsheet-style grid where each row is an issue, PR, or draft item. Columns are fields (Title, Status, Assignee, Labels, Priority, custom fields you create).

**What it's best for:** Bulk editing, sorting, filtering, seeing many items at once with their field values.

**Keyboard navigation:**
```
T                     → Jump to table
↑/↓                   → Move between rows
←/→                   → Move between columns
Enter                 → Open item detail panel (right sidebar)
Escape                → Close detail panel
Space (on a cell)     → Edit that cell's value
F2 (on title cell)    → Edit title inline
```

**Screen reader output per row:**
> "Fix keyboard trap in modal dialog | Status: In Progress | Assignee: alice | Priority: High | Labels: bug, accessibility"

### Board View

Kanban-style columns. Each column represents a status value. Cards can be dragged between columns (or updated via keyboard by editing the Status field).

**What it's best for:** Visual workflow tracking, seeing WIP (work in progress), standup-style status reviews.

**Screen reader note:** Drag-and-drop is not keyboard accessible. Change a card's column by opening it and editing the Status field instead.

**Keyboard navigation:**
```
Tab                   → Move between columns and cards
Enter (on a card)     → Open item detail panel
B                     → Jump to board regions (if heading navigation)
Within a card:
  Enter               → Open panel
  Space               → Toggle selection (for bulk moves)
```

**Change a card's column without dragging:**
1. `Enter` to open the card
2. Navigate to the **Status** field in the right panel
3. Activate the Status dropdown
4. Select the new column value
5. `Escape` to close

### Roadmap View

A horizontal timeline. Items appear as bars spanning their start/due dates. Iterations and milestones can be visualized against real calendar time.

**What it's best for:** Release planning, sprint capacity planning, communicating timelines to stakeholders.

**Screen reader note:** Roadmap is chart-based. The underlying data is still fully accessible via the Table view — treat Roadmap as a visual summary, and use Table for all editing.

**Setting dates:**
- Add a **Date** custom field (e.g., "Start Date", "Due Date") or use a **Milestone** field
- Items without dates appear in the ungrouped section

---

## 4. Custom Fields

This is one of Projects v2's most powerful features. You can add fields beyond the GitHub defaults (Title, Assignee, Labels, Milestone, Repository).

### Field Types

| Type | Use Case | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Text** | Free-form notes | "Acceptance criteria", "Design link" |
| **Number** | Story points, estimates | "Points: 3" |
| **Date** | Deadlines, start dates | "Due: 2025-06-15" |
| **Single select** | Priority, size, type | Priority: P0 / P1 / P2 |
| **Iteration** | Sprint/cycle tracking | See Section 7 |

### Creating a Custom Field

From any project view:
1. In Table view, scroll right to the `+` button at the end of the column header row
2. Activate the `+` button
3. Select a field type
4. Name the field and configure options (for select fields, type each option, press Enter to add more)
5. Confirm — the field appears as a new column

**Screen reader path:**
```
Tab to "+" column header button → Enter
→ Field type menu opens → ↑/↓ to choose type → Enter
→ Name field: type field name
→ For "Single select": type option names, Tab/Enter between options
→ "Save" button → Enter
```

### Editing a Field Value on an Item

1. In Table view, navigate to the cell where the field intersects the row
2. `Enter` or `Space` to activate the editor
3. Type value (text/number) or select from dropdown (single select)
4. `Enter` or `Tab` to confirm

---

## 5. Adding and Managing Items

### Add an Existing Issue or PR

From any project view:
1. Activate the **"+ Add item"** button at the bottom of a table/column
2. Type `#` to trigger the issue/PR search
3. Type a keyword or issue number
4. Select the item — it's added to the project
5. The issue/PR is now tracked in the project; it still lives in its repository

**Tip:** The issue itself will now show which projects it belongs to in its sidebar.

### Add a Draft Issue

Draft issues live only inside the project (not in any repository) until you promote them.

1. Activate **"+ Add item"**
2. Type the title directly (no `#`)
3. Press `Enter` — a draft row appears
4. Open the draft → **"Convert to issue"** button → select the repository

**When to use drafts:** Capturing ideas during planning before you're ready to commit them to a repo.

### Promote a Draft to an Issue

1. Open the draft item (`Enter` on the row)
2. Activate **"Convert to issue"** in the panel
3. Select the target repository from the dropdown
4. Confirm — the draft becomes a real issue in that repo

### Bulk Edit Items

In Table view:
1. Check the checkbox on each row (first column, `Space` to toggle)
2. A bulk action bar appears at the top
3. Options: change Status, assign label, change assignee, archive, delete

---

## 6. Built-In Automations

Projects v2 has native automation rules — no GitHub Actions YAML required.

### Accessing Automations

From a project:
1. Select the `...` menu (project overflow) in the top-right
2. Select **"Workflows"**
3. You'll see a list of built-in automation rules you can enable/disable

### Available Built-In Workflows

| Workflow | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Item added to project** | When an item is manually added, set its Status to a chosen value |
| **Item reopened** | When an issue/PR is reopened, change its Status (e.g., back to "In Progress") |
| **Item closed** | When an issue/PR is closed, set Status to "Done" automatically |
| **Pull request merged** | When a PR is merged, set its Status to "Done" |
| **Auto-add to project** | Items matching a filter (by label, type, repo) are automatically added to the project |

### Setting Up Auto-Add

This is the most powerful workflow for maintainers:

1. In **Workflows**, select **"Auto-add to project"**
2. Toggle it **On**
3. Configure the filter: e.g., `label:accessibility is:issue` adds any new issue with the accessibility label automatically
4. Save

Now any matching issue in linked repos is added to your project the moment it's filed — no manual triage step required.

### GitHub Actions Integration

For more complex automations, Projects v2 has a full GraphQL API and works with GitHub Actions. Example use cases:
- Auto-assign items based on repository when added
- Set due dates based on linked milestone
- Send Slack notifications when high-priority items are added

See [Appendix Q: GitHub Actions and Workflows](appendix-q-github-actions-workflows.md) for the foundation, and the [GitHub documentation on automating projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project) for advanced patterns.

## 7. Iterations (Sprints)

An **iteration** field lets you group work into time-boxed cycles — sprints, weeks, or any cadence you choose.

### Creating an Iteration Field

1. Add a new field (the `+` column button in Table view)
2. Select **"Iteration"** as the field type
3. Name it (e.g., "Sprint")
4. Set the iteration duration (1 week, 2 weeks, custom)
5. GitHub automatically generates current and upcoming iterations

### Using Iterations

- Each item can be assigned to an iteration via the Iteration field
- In Board view, you can group by iteration to see a sprint board
- In Roadmap view, iterations appear as blocks on the timeline
- **Burndown:** No built-in burndown chart, but the Insights charts (see below) can show progress

### Iteration Insights

From any project:
1. Select the **Insights** tab (the bar chart icon)
2. Select **"Current iteration"**
3. See: items by status, completion rate, items added vs closed over time

---

## 8. Views and Filters

A **view** is a saved configuration of layout + filters + grouping + sort. You can have many views on one project, each showing a different slice of the data.

### Creating a View

1. Activate the **"+ New view"** button in the view tab bar
2. Choose layout (Table, Board, Roadmap)
3. Configure filters, grouping, sort
4. The view saves automatically with a default name — rename by clicking/activating the tab label

### Filter Syntax

The filter bar accepts a query language similar to GitHub's issue search:

| Query | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `status:In Progress` | Show only items with that Status value |
| `assignee:@me` | Show only items assigned to you |
| `label:accessibility` | Items with the accessibility label |
| `milestone:"v2.0"` | Items in a specific milestone |
| `no:assignee` | Items with no assignee |
| `is:pr` | Only pull requests |
| `is:issue` | Only issues |
| `repo:owner/name` | Items from a specific repo (cross-repo projects) |

Combine filters: `assignee:@me status:"In Progress"` shows your in-progress work.

### Grouping

In Table or Board view, you can group rows:
1. Select **"Group by"** in the view configuration menu
2. Choose any field: Status, Assignee, Priority, Iteration, Label, Repository
3. Items are collapsible into group sections

### Sorting

Multiple sort levels are supported. Primary sort → secondary sort:
- Priority ascending, then due date ascending

---

## 9. Cross-Repository Projects

A single project can track issues and PRs from **multiple repositories** — including repos in different organizations (if you have access).

### Add a Repository to a Project

1. In project settings (the `...` overflow menu → **"Settings"**)
2. Select **"Manage access"** → **"Add repository"**
3. Search and select additional repositories
4. Items from those repos can now be added to the project

### Using the Repository Field

When a project spans multiple repos, the **"Repository"** field lets you see — and filter by — which repo each item belongs to:

```
Filter: repo:accesswatch/agent-forge
→ Show only agent-forge issues in this cross-repo project
```

**Common use case:** An organization project tracking all accessibility bugs across every repo, labeled `accessibility`, with Auto-add enabled.

## 10. Screen Reader Navigation Reference

### Project Home Page (list of projects)

```
3 → Jump to project titles (they are h3 links)
Enter → Open a project
```

### Inside a Project — General

```
Tab → Move between interactive elements (view tabs, filters, fields, buttons)
F6 → Cycle between major panels (header, view tabs, content area)
/ → Focus the filter bar (if supported; otherwise Tab to reach it)
```

### Table View

```
T or Region → Jump to the table data region
↑/↓ → Navigate rows
←/→ → Navigate columns within a row
Enter → Open item detail panel
Space → Toggle row selection
Escape → Close detail panel or cancel edit
F2 → Edit a title cell if focused
```

**NVDA note:** Use Browse mode (NVDA+Space to toggle) to read all cell content, then App mode (NVDA+Space again) for interactive editing. NVDA announces cell content as you navigate with arrow keys.

**JAWS note:** Use JAWS cursor (JAWS+P) to read grid cell content. For interactive editing, press Enter to enter application mode in the table.

**VoiceOver note:** Use VO+Shift+↓ to interact with the table. VO+←/→ moves between cells. Press VO+Space to activate a cell for editing.

### Board View

```
Tab → Move between cards and column headers
Enter (on card) → Open detail panel
The "Status" field in the panel → Change the card's column
```

### Detail Panel (right sidebar, any view)

```

## 11. Agent Forge: `/project-status`

The **`/project-status`** command from Agent Forge gives you a live project board overview directly in VS Code Copilot Chat, without opening a browser.

### What It Shows

```
/project-status accesswatch/agent-forge
```

- Items per column (Todo, In Progress, Done, etc.) with assignees and average age
- Blocked items (labeled "blocked" or flagged with a field value)
- Stale items — in the same column for 7+ days with no activity
- Unassigned items in active columns
- Team member workload (anyone with 5+ items in progress)
- Sprint/iteration progress if an Iteration field is configured

### Example Output

```
GitHub Project: Agent Forge Roadmap (3 active views)

Column Breakdown:
┌─────────────┬───────┬──────────────────┬─────────┬──────────────┐
│ Column      │ Items │ Assignees        │ Avg Age │ Stale (7d+) │
├─────────────┼───────┼──────────────────┼─────────┼──────────────┤
│ To Do       │   8   │ @alice(3),@bob(2) │ 5 days  │     1       │
│ In Progress │   4   │ @charlie(2)       │ 3 days  │     0       │
│ In Review   │   2   │ --               │ 2 days  │     0       │
│ Done        │  23   │ --               │  --     │    --       │
└─────────────┴───────┴──────────────────┴─────────┴──────────────┘

Attention Items:
  Stale: "Update screen reader navigation guide" — In Review for 9 days, no activity
  Unassigned: "Triage accessibility bug backlog" in In Progress

After the overview: "Want to see a specific column or check a team member's workload?"
```

### When to Use It

- During standup: quick status snapshot without leaving VS Code
- Before filing a new issue: see if it's already tracked
- During sprint planning: identify stale and blocked items before the next cycle
- After a weekend: catch up on what moved while you were away

## 12. Exercises

### Exercise 1: Create a Personal Tracking Project

1. Create a new project at the organization level: name it "My Workshop Contributions"
2. Add the **Board** layout
3. Add a custom **Priority** field with options: P0, P1, P2
4. Add your fork of `agent-forge` as a linked repository
5. Add any open issue you've filed to the project

### Exercise 2: Set Up Automation

1. In your project's **Workflows**, enable **"Item closed"** → Status: Done
2. File a test issue in your fork
3. Close that issue
4. Verify it moved to "Done" automatically in the project board

### Exercise 3: Create a Sprint View

1. Add an **Iteration** field named "Sprint" with 2-week iterations
2. Assign your existing project items to the current sprint
3. Switch to **Roadmap** view — observe the items on the timeline
4. Check **Insights** to see the current iteration burndown

### Exercise 4: Cross-Repo Project (Advanced)

1. Create a cross-repo project connected to two of your repositories
2. Add the **Repository** field to the Table view
3. Create a view filtered to `is:issue label:accessibility`
4. Set up Auto-add: any issue with the `accessibility` label in those repos goes to this project automatically
