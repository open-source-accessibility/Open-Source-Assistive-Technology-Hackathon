# Appendix N: GitHub Codespaces
## Cloud Development Environments — Accessibility Guide

> GitHub Codespaces gives you a full VS Code development environment in your browser or connected to your local VS Code, running on a cloud machine. For screen reader users, this means a consistent, pre-configured environment with no local setup required.

## 1. What Is GitHub Codespaces?

A Codespace is a cloud-hosted development environment. When you open one, GitHub provisions a virtual machine, clones your repository into it, and connects it to a VS Code interface — either in your browser or via your local VS Code Desktop.

**Why this matters for accessibility:**

- No local installation of tools, compilers, or language runtimes required
- Your screen reader and OS settings stay on your machine; only the editor runs in the cloud
- VS Code's full accessibility features (audio cues, screen reader optimized mode, diff viewer) are available
- The environment is identical for every workshop participant — facilitators can reproduce issues reliably

**Free tier:** GitHub provides a monthly free allowance of Codespace hours for personal accounts. Workshop usage typically falls well within the free tier.

---

## 2. Creating a Codespace

### From a Repository Page

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub
2. Press the **Code** button (keyboard shortcut: there is no direct shortcut — Tab to the button)
3. In the panel that opens, choose the **Codespaces** tab
4. Activate **Create codespace on main** (or your branch name)
5. The Codespace opens in a new browser tab after provisioning (typically 30–60 seconds)

### From the Codespaces Dashboard

1. Go to [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)
2. Activate **New codespace**
3. Use the search field to find your repository
4. Choose a branch, machine type, and region
5. Activate **Create codespace**

### Machine Types

| Type | CPU | RAM | Best for |
|------|-----|-----|----------|
| 2-core | 2 vCPU | 8 GB | General development, documentation |
| 4-core | 4 vCPU | 16 GB | Builds, tests, moderate workloads |
| 8-core | 8 vCPU | 32 GB | Heavy builds, multiple services |

For workshop exercises, the default 2-core machine is sufficient.

## 3. Codespace Environments

### Browser (VS Code for the Web)

The Codespace opens directly in your browser as a fully functional VS Code interface.

- Works in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari
- Screen reader support varies slightly by browser — Chrome and Edge have the most consistent behavior with NVDA and JAWS
- No installation needed
- Some VS Code extensions are not available in the browser version

### Local VS Code Desktop

If you prefer your local VS Code setup with your extensions and settings:

1. Install the [GitHub Codespaces extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) in VS Code
2. Sign in to GitHub in VS Code
3. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
4. Run **Codespaces: Connect to Codespace**
5. Select an existing Codespace or create a new one

When connected via local VS Code, your screen reader interacts with your local VS Code installation — all your familiar settings apply.

---

## 4. Accessibility in Codespaces

### Screen Reader Optimized Mode

When VS Code detects a screen reader, it automatically activates **Screen Reader Optimized** mode. You can verify or toggle it manually:

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Search for **Toggle Screen Reader Accessibility Mode**
3. Press Enter to activate

In this mode:
- The editor reads content line by line instead of character by character
- Diff views are rendered as accessible text comparisons
- Inline suggestions from Copilot are announced on a keypress rather than automatically

### Audio Cues

VS Code in Codespaces supports the same audio cues as the desktop version:

| Event | Default Audio Cue |
|-------|------------------|
| Error on current line | Tone |
| Warning on current line | Tone |
| Breakpoint hit | Tone |
| Task completed | Chime |
| Copilot suggestion available | Tone |

Enable audio cues via Settings → search for "audio cues" or run **Help: List Audio Cues** from the Command Palette.

### Terminal Accessibility

The integrated terminal in a Codespace is a standard terminal:

- Screen readers read terminal output in NVDA and JAWS using their document/browse mode after output arrives
- In NVDA: Switch to Browse Mode to read static terminal output, then back to Focus Mode to type
- VS Code also has **Accessible View** (`Alt+F2` when cursor is in the terminal) which renders terminal output in a navigable buffer

---

## 5. Screen Reader Configuration

### NVDA

No special NVDA profile is required for Codespaces in the browser. The same settings recommended in [Appendix B](appendix-b-screen-reader-cheatsheet.md) apply:

- Ensure Browse Mode is on for reading, Focus Mode for typing
- Set maximum line length to 10000 in NVDA Settings → Browse Mode
- In Chrome or Edge, NVDA's Browse Mode detection is generally reliable

### JAWS

- Use Virtual Cursor for reading page content
- Switch to PC Cursor (Insert+Z or Num Pad Plus) when inside the editor and writing code
- JAWS works best with the Codespace in Chrome or Edge

### VoiceOver (macOS)

- Use Quick Nav (Left+Right arrows) for moving through the VS Code interface
- The Rotor (VO+U) surfaces VS Code's landmark regions
- If text in the editor is not reading fluently, ensure Screen Reader Optimized mode is active (see above)

---

## 6. Keyboard Shortcuts in Codespaces

Codespaces uses standard VS Code keyboard shortcuts. The most important ones for workshop exercises:

### Navigation

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Ctrl+Shift+P | Command Palette |
| Ctrl+P | Quick Open (search files by name) |
| Ctrl+` | Toggle integrated terminal |
| Ctrl+Shift+E | Explorer panel |
| Ctrl+Shift+G | Source Control panel |
| Ctrl+Shift+X | Extensions panel |
| Ctrl+B | Toggle sidebar |

### Editor

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Ctrl+Shift+K | Delete line |
| Alt+↑ / Alt+↓ | Move line up/down |
| Ctrl+/ | Toggle line comment |
| Ctrl+G | Go to line number |
| F8 | Next error or warning |
| Shift+F8 | Previous error or warning |
| Alt+F2 | Accessible View (terminal, notifications, Copilot output) |

### Source Control

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Ctrl+Shift+G | Open Source Control panel |
| Ctrl+Enter | Commit (when focus is on message field) |

## 7. Managing Your Codespaces

### Stopping a Codespace

Codespaces automatically stop after a period of inactivity (default: 30 minutes). To stop manually:

1. Go to [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)
2. Find your Codespace in the list
3. Activate the **…** menu next to it
4. Choose **Stop codespace**

Stopped Codespaces retain your files and changes. They do not use compute hours while stopped.

### Deleting a Codespace

1. Go to [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)
2. Activate the **…** menu next to the Codespace
3. Choose **Delete**

> **Note:** Deleting a Codespace removes any uncommitted or unpushed changes permanently. Always commit and push your work before deleting.

### Resuming a Codespace

1. Go to [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)
2. Find your stopped Codespace
3. Activate **Open in …** to resume it in the browser or in VS Code Desktop

---

## 8. Dotfiles and Persistent Configuration

If you have a repository named `dotfiles` on your GitHub account, Codespaces will automatically apply it when provisioning new environments. This is useful for:

- Setting your preferred shell (bash, zsh, fish)
- Adding shell aliases and functions
- Pre-installing command-line tools

To set up dotfiles: create a repository named `dotfiles` and add an `install.sh` script. Codespaces will run it automatically.

VS Code settings (themes, font size, keybindings) can be synchronized to Codespaces via **Settings Sync** (sign in with your GitHub account in VS Code settings).

---

## 9. Codespaces vs GitHub.dev

| Feature | GitHub Codespaces | GitHub.dev |
|---------|-----------------|------------|
| Access | github.com/codespaces or press `.` then choose Codespaces | Press `.` on any repository |
| Terminal | Yes — full terminal | No terminal |
| Extensions | Most VS Code extensions | Web-compatible extensions only |
| Run code | Yes | No |
| Cost | Free tier, then usage-based | Free |
| Screen reader support | Full VS Code + terminal | Full VS Code (no terminal) |
| Best for | Active development, running tests | Quick edits, reading code |

For workshop exercises that involve running scripts or tests, use Codespaces. For quickly browsing or editing a file, GitHub.dev is faster to open.

---

## 10. Common Issues and Workarounds

**The Codespace takes a long time to open:**
Provisioning a new Codespace can take up to 90 seconds. If it hangs beyond that, refresh the browser tab and try again. Resuming an existing Codespace is much faster (5–10 seconds).

**Screen reader stops reading after I switch to the terminal:**
Switch to Browse Mode (NVDA: Insert+Space; JAWS: Insert+Z) to read the terminal output, then return to Focus Mode to type your next command.

**Audio cues are not working in the browser:**
Some browsers mute audio by default for new tabs. Check your browser's site permissions to ensure audio is allowed for github.dev or the Codespace URL.

**Extensions I rely on locally are not available:**
Some extensions are not compatible with the browser-based VS Code. Connect to the Codespace via VS Code Desktop instead (see [Section 3](#3-codespace-environments)) to access your full extension library.

**I accidentally deleted my Codespace before pushing:**
If the branch exists on GitHub, you can create a new Codespace from it. Uncommitted changes in a deleted Codespace cannot be recovered.

**My changes are not showing in GitHub after committing:**
You may have committed but not pushed. In the Source Control panel, look for the **Sync Changes** or **Push** button. Run `git push` in the terminal if needed.
