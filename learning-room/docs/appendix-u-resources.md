## 3. GitHub Skills Learning Modules

GitHub Skills is GitHub's free, self-paced interactive learning platform. Every course runs **entirely inside GitHub** — no external site, no separate login, no video to watch. Each course uses the **template-copy pattern**: you copy the course repository to your account, and Mona (GitHub's official education bot) activates and teaches you entirely through issues and pull requests.

### How GitHub Skills Works

Unlike a conventional course where you watch videos or read slides, GitHub Skills teaches through doing:

1. **Copy the course:** Select "Start course" → "Use this template" → "Create a new repository." This copies the course scaffold to your own account.
2. **Mona activates:** A GitHub Actions workflow automatically runs — within 20 seconds, Mona opens your first lesson as an Issue in your new repository.
3. **Read and act:** The issue contains step-by-step instructions. You do the task (commit a file, open a PR, resolve a conflict) in the **same repository**.
4. **Mona validates:** Another GitHub Actions workflow detects what you did, checks if it's correct, and either advances you to the next step or gives you feedback to try again.
5. **Repeat until done:** All feedback arrives as issue comments and new issues. The course is complete when Mona closes the final issue with a success message.

### Screen Reader Navigation of a GitHub Skills Course

Since everything happens in GitHub, the accessibility skills from this workshop apply directly:

```
Starting a course:
  Navigate to the module URL
  B → "Start course" button → Enter
  B → "Use this template" → Enter
  B → "Create a new repository" → Enter
  Fill in repo name → Tab → "Create repository" → Enter

Following lessons:
  Navigate to your new repo's Issues tab (G then I)
  H or 3 → find "Step 1:" issue heading → Enter to open it
  Read instructions with ↓ in Browse Mode
  Complete the task described → commit / PR / edit as instructed
  Wait ~20 seconds → Mona posts a follow-up comment or opens the next issue
  9 (NVDA/JAWS) → navigate to comments to read Mona's feedback
```

## 7. GitHub Agentic Workflows

GitHub Agentic Workflows are in **technical preview** as of February 2026. Access, feedback channels, and setup information:

| Resource | URL | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Agentic Workflows Blog Post | [github.blog/ai-and-ml/automate-repository-tasks-with-github-agentic-workflows](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/automate-repository-tasks-with-github-agentic-workflows/) | The announcement — explains the full model |
| `gh-aw` CLI Extension | `gh extension install github/gh-aw` | Install via GitHub CLI |
| Technical Preview Feedback | [gh.io/aw-tp-community-feedback](https://gh.io/aw-tp-community-feedback) | Community discussion for the preview |
| GitHub Next Discord | [gh.io/next-discord](https://gh.io/next-discord) | Real-time discussion with the GitHub Next team |

**How Agentic Workflows connect to what you learned:**

During the workshop, you learned:
1. Standard GitHub Actions (YAML workflows — triggers, jobs, steps)
2. Agent Forge agents (`.agent.md` files — plain English instructions, Copilot Chat executor)
3. GitHub Agentic Workflows (`.md` files in `.github/workflows/` — plain English instructions, cloud-based coding agent executor)

All three live in `.github/`. All three are plain text. The only difference is where they run and how sophisticated their executor is.

## 8. Spec-Driven Development — Spec Kit

| Resource | URL | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Spec Kit — GitHub Repo | [github.com/github/spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) | Open source, MIT license |
| Spec Kit Blog Post | [github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/spec-driven-development-with-ai-get-started-with-a-new-open-source-toolkit](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/spec-driven-development-with-ai-get-started-with-a-new-open-source-toolkit/) | Full explanation of the methodology |

**The core idea:** Write the intent of a feature before anyone builds it. The specification is a living document — AI uses it to plan tasks, contributors use it to stay aligned, the community uses it to evaluate whether the outcome matched the intention.

**Quick start:**
```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```

**Slash commands:**
- `/specify` — open a new specification session
- `/plan` — convert a spec into a development plan
- `/tasks` — break the plan into trackable tasks

Works with GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI.

## 11. GitHub Best Practices and Power Features

Essential tips and lesser-known features that make you a more effective contributor.

### Saved Replies

Saved replies let you create reusable text templates for common responses. Perfect for:
- Thanking first-time contributors
- Requesting more information with a friendly tone
- Explaining common setup issues
- Closing duplicate issues

**How to set up:**
1. Go to [github.com/settings/replies](https://github.com/settings/replies)
2. Click "Add a saved reply"
3. Give it a short label (e.g., "welcome-first-time")
4. Write your template text (can include Markdown)
5. Save

**How to use:**
- When writing any comment, press `Ctrl+.` (period) to open the saved replies menu
- Select your saved reply
- Edit as needed before posting

### Pinned Issues

Pin important issues to the top of your repository's Issues tab. Perfect for:
- FAQs and getting started guides
- Known issues and workarounds
- Roadmap and project status updates
- Community guidelines

**How to pin an issue:**
1. Open the issue you want to pin
2. In the right sidebar, click the three-dot menu (⋯)
3. Select "Pin issue"
4. It now appears at the top of the Issues list

You can pin up to 3 issues per repository. Pinned issues are visible to everyone, even those who haven't starred or watched your repo.

### Pinned Comments (New: Feb 2026)

You can now pin a single comment within an issue thread to keep important information visible. Perfect for:
- Workarounds or temporary solutions
- Decisions made during discussion
- Links to related issues or PRs
- Status updates from maintainers

**How to pin a comment:**
1. Find the comment you want to pin
2. Click the three-dot menu (⋯) on the comment
3. Select "Pin comment"

Only repository collaborators can pin comments. There can be only one pinned comment per issue.

### Linking to Specific Lines of Code

Share precise references to code by including line numbers in GitHub URLs.

**Syntax:**
- Single line: `github.com/owner/repo/blob/main/file.js#L42`
- Line range: `github.com/owner/repo/blob/main/file.js#L42-L58`

**How to create these links:**
1. Navigate to a file on GitHub
2. Click the line number (in screen readers: navigate to the line and activate the number link)
3. Hold `Shift` and click another line number to select a range
4. Copy the URL from your browser — the line numbers are automatically included

**Screen reader tip:** Line numbers are links announced as "Line 42 link" (or similar). They're in the left margin of the code view.

### Permalinks — Stable Links That Never Break

When you link to code on GitHub using a branch name (`main`, `develop`), that link can break if the code changes or the file moves. **Permalinks** use the commit SHA instead of the branch name, creating a permanent snapshot link.

**Why this matters:** When you file a bug report or reference code in a discussion, you want the link to show exactly what you were looking at — not what the code looks like weeks later after someone refactored it.

**How to create a permalink:**
1. View any file on GitHub
2. Press `Y` while viewing the file — the URL changes from `/blob/main/file.js` to `/blob/a1b2c3d4.../file.js`
3. Copy the new URL — it now points to that specific commit

**Shortcut:** `Y` = "Yank permalink" (borrows from Vim terminology)

### Converting Issues to Discussions

Not every issue is a bug or feature request. Some are questions, proposals, or open-ended conversations. GitHub Discussions provide a better home for these.

**When to convert:**
- Questions that don't require a code change ("How do I configure X?")
- Proposals that need community feedback before becoming actionable
- General discussion about the project's direction
- Show-and-tell or community showcases

**How to convert an issue to a discussion:**
1. Open the issue
2. In the right sidebar, click "Convert to discussion"
3. Select which discussion category it belongs in
4. Confirm

All comments and history are preserved. The issue is closed and replaced with a link to the new discussion.

### Team Mentions — Notify a Whole Group

In organizations, you can mention entire teams instead of individuals: `@org-name/team-name`

**Example:** `@github/accessibility` notifies everyone on GitHub's accessibility team.

**Why this matters:**
- You don't need to know who's on a team — just mention the team
- Teams can subscribe to notifications as a group
- CODEOWNERS files use team mentions for automatic reviewer assignment

**Permission:** You can only mention teams you have visibility to. Public teams in public orgs can be mentioned by anyone.

### Collapsible Sections in Markdown

Keep long issue descriptions or PR descriptions scannable by hiding details in collapsible sections.

**Syntax:**
```markdown
<details>
<summary>Click to expand: Full error stack trace</summary>

(Your detailed content here — code blocks, lists, anything)

</details>
```

**Use for:**
- Long error messages or logs
- Optional context that most readers don't need
- Large screenshots or code samples
- Step-by-step troubleshooting instructions

**Accessibility note:** Collapsible sections are announced as "disclosure triangles" or "expandable" regions by most screen readers. The summary text is always visible.

### Co-Authored Commits

Credit multiple people for a single commit using the `Co-authored-by` trailer in your commit message.

**Syntax:**
```
Fix keyboard navigation in modal dialog

This addresses the issue where focus was lost when the modal closed.

Co-authored-by: Alex Chen <alex@example.com>
Co-authored-by: Jordan Smith <jordan@example.com>
```

**Why this matters:**
- Pair programming — both people get credit in the Git history
- Crediting someone who provided the solution but didn't write the code
- GitHub recognizes these trailers and shows all co-authors on the commit

**Screen reader tip:** When viewing a commit with co-authors on GitHub, screen readers announce "Co-authored-by" in the commit details.

### Understanding Watch, Star, and Fork

Three ways to interact with a repository — each means something different:

| Action | What It Does | When to Use |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Watch** | Subscribe to notifications for activity | You want to stay updated on issues, PRs, and releases |
| **Star** | Bookmark a repo | You want to save it for later or show appreciation |
| **Fork** | Create your own copy of the repo | You want to contribute changes or use it as a starting point |

**Watch settings:**
- **All activity** — every issue, PR, and discussion
- **Participating** (default) — only threads you comment on or are @mentioned in
- **Releases only** — just new releases
- **Ignore** — unsubscribe completely

**Pro tip:** Star repos for discovery; Watch repos you actively contribute to.

### CODEOWNERS — Automatic Reviewer Assignment

The `CODEOWNERS` file automatically requests reviews from specific people or teams when files in their area are changed.

**Location:** `.github/CODEOWNERS` in your repository

**Syntax:**
```
# Documentation team reviews all docs changes
/docs/ @org-name/docs-team

# Accessibility specialist reviews UI changes
/src/components/ @username

# Security team reviews authentication code
/src/auth/ @org-name/security-team

# Default owner for everything else
* @project-lead
```

**How it works:**
1. Someone opens a PR that changes files in `/docs/`
2. GitHub automatically requests a review from `@org-name/docs-team`
3. The PR can't be merged until the required review is approved (if branch protection requires it)

**Use for:**
- Ensuring domain experts review specialized code
- Distributing review responsibilities
- Preventing changes from being merged without appropriate oversight

### GitHub Sponsors

Support open source maintainers financially through GitHub Sponsors. If a project you use has a "Sponsor" button, consider supporting them.

**How it works:**
- Maintainers set up a Sponsors profile
- You can sponsor with a monthly recurring amount or one-time payment
- GitHub doesn't take a fee (as of 2026)

**Why sponsor:**
- Open source maintainers often work for free in their spare time
- Your sponsorship helps them dedicate more time to the project
- Many maintainers offer perks to sponsors (early access, prioritized issues, etc.)

**How to sponsor:**
1. Visit a repository with a "Sponsor" button
2. Click the button
3. Choose a sponsorship tier
4. Complete payment through GitHub Sponsors

### Advanced Markdown Features

GitHub supports several powerful Markdown features beyond the basics:

**Task Lists:**
```markdown
- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Pending task
- [ ] Another pending task
```

**Tables with alignment:**
```markdown
| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
|:-------------|:--------------:|--------------:|
| Text         | Text           | Text          |
```

**Mermaid Diagrams:**
````markdown
