# Course Guide
## GitHub Learning Room — Your Complete Workshop Companion

> **Welcome.** You are about to begin a two-day journey into open source collaboration using GitHub, VS Code, and GitHub Copilot — all designed for screen reader and keyboard-only navigation. This guide is your starting point and table of contents for everything in this workshop.

---

## How This Course Works

This is a two-day workshop built around one idea: **you will make real contributions to a real open source project.** Not simulated. Not pretend. Real.

### The Two Days

**Day 1 — GitHub Foundations (Browser)**
You learn GitHub's web interface using only your keyboard and screen reader. By the end of Day 1, you will have filed issues, opened pull requests, reviewed someone else's work, and resolved a merge conflict — all in the browser.

**Day 2 — VS Code + Agent Forge (Desktop)**
You move to Visual Studio Code, learn GitHub Copilot, and activate Agent Forge — six AI agents that amplify every skill you built on Day 1. By the end of Day 2, your name is in the commit history of a real open source accessibility project.

### The Journey Arc

```
Day 1 — Learn the skill in the browser
  Navigate → Issue → Pull Request → Review → Merge

     ↓  (bridge: press . on any GitHub repo — VS Code opens in your browser)

github.dev — VS Code on the web, no install needed
  Same keyboard shortcuts · Same screen reader mode · Edit files · Open PRs

     ↓  (you've earned the desktop — now it makes sense)

Day 2 — Deepen with VS Code + Agent Forge
  VS Code basics → Copilot inline → Copilot Chat
  @daily-briefing → @issue-tracker → @pr-review → @analytics → ship upstream
```

**The key principle:** Learn the manual skill first, then see how it is automated. The agents only make sense when you already understand what they are doing.

## Before You Begin

Complete everything in **[Chapter 0: Pre-Workshop Setup](00-pre-workshop-setup.md)** before Day 1. This chapter walks you through:

- Creating a GitHub account
- Installing Git
- Setting up VS Code (optional for Day 1, required for Day 2)
- Configuring your screen reader for GitHub
- Verifying everything works

**Time needed:** About 30 minutes.
