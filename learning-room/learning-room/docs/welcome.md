# Welcome to Open Source Contribution

This guide is for people who are new to contributing to open source software. It explains what contribution means, who it is for, and how to get started.

---

## What Is Open Source?

Open source software is software whose source code is publicly available. Anyone can read it, use it, and — in most cases — contribute to it. Contributions can include:

- Fixing bugs in the software
- Writing or improving documentation
- Filing bug reports
- Reviewing other people's changes
- Translating content into other languages
- Improving accessibility

You do not need to be a professional developer to contribute. Documentation, accessibility improvements, and bug reports are among the most valuable contributions an open source project can receive.

## Who Can Contribute?

[TODO: Add a paragraph explaining that contributors come from all backgrounds, skill levels, and countries. Emphasize that using assistive technology is not a barrier to contribution — in fact, AT users bring a perspective that improves projects for everyone.]

---

## What Makes a Good First Contribution?

A good first contribution is:

- **Specific** — it addresses one problem clearly
- **Scoped** — it does not try to fix everything at once
- **Described** — the PR or issue explains what changed and why
- **Tested** — for documentation, this means reading it aloud with your screen reader before submitting

## Finding Something to Work On

Most open source projects label issues that are suitable for new contributors. Look for:

- `good first issue`
- `first-timers-only`
- `help wanted`
- `beginner`

[TODO: Add two or three sentences about how to read an issue to decide if it is right for you. What questions should you ask yourself? Is the description clear enough? Is anyone else already working on it?]

---

## Getting Help

It is always acceptable to ask a question on an issue or pull request. Good questions:

- Are specific: "I'm trying to fix the broken link on line 24 of setup-guide.md. The link currently points to /docs/old-setup. Where should it point?"
- Show what you tried: "I searched the repository for the correct URL but couldn't find it"
- Are polite: assume good intent from maintainers, even if they are slow to respond

---

## After Your Contribution Is Merged

When your pull request is merged:

- Your name appears in the project's commit history permanently
- The issue you fixed is closed
- You are officially listed as a contributor to this project

[TODO: Add a sentence or two about what this means for someone's GitHub profile and open source portfolio.]
